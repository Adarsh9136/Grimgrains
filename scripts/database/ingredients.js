    & Devine & I are daily coffee drinkers, we sometimes have a second cup in the afternoon, but typically we limit ourselves to a single cup in the morning. We drink it {*black*}, but enjoy the occasional flat white as a treat.
    & We grind new beans each morning with a portable manual {{coffee grinder|http://www.amzn.to/2p0pO2p}}. We mainly use a stainless steel moka pot for espresso, the model is the {{IKAE Radig|http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30149839/}}, which we found it in a bin at a marina in New Zealand. 
    * Moka Pot
    & To make a perfect espresso with the moka pot, here are a few things to remember:
    - The grind should be only slightly smaller than filter coffee.
    - Warm up the water in the bottom part before screwing the top section.
    - Remove from heat when you hear the sound of bubbles.
    - Take apart and clean the machine after each use.

    & I'm not saying that these brands are the very best, but they suit our needs. We bought these while in Victoria BC from MEC. GSI is the in-store brand for camping goods, their products have not failed us yet, and so we like to recommend them.
    & To finish, here is a list of the coffee places we've tried (and loved) in our travels:
