    * Coffee on Pino
    & Devine & I are coffee drinkers, we have a one per day. We have a second cup on occasion - or, second wind, as we like to call it. We drink it black, but enjoy having a flat white (has less milk than a latte) with a {{non-dairy milk|Soy Milk}} as a treat.
    & Most times, we have a cup at home on {{Pino|http://100r.co}}, and so having good coffee gear is essential. We had two requirements: {{portability and durability|http://100r.co/resources.html#habitat}}. (Two of my glass presses have made friends with the floor in the past.)
    & Our first buy, was a {{GSI outdoors french press|http://www.amzn.to/2FrWg8a}}. It's BPA-free (made from co-polyester), and shatter resistant - perfect for those of us prone to recurrent bouts of clumsiness.
    & We like to grind our own beans, so we got a {{GSI outdoors coffee grinder|http://www.amzn.to/2p0pO2p}}. Non-electric, and portable. 
    & Sometimes, we use a stainless steel moka pot for espresso. The model is an {{ikea RADIG espresso pot|http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30149839/}}, we found it in a bin at the marina. I didn't know ikea made moka pots.  I can't say this would be my first choice, but it was free and it works so... ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯.
    % blog/coffee.2.jpg
    & I'm not saying that these brands are the very best, but they suit our needs. We bought these while in Victoria BC from MEC. GSI is the in-store brand for camping goods, their products have not failed us yet, and so we like to recommend them.
    & To finish, here is a list of the coffee places we've tried (and loved) in our travels:
    - {{Prado|https://pradocafe.co}} - Vancouver, CA
    - {{Cafe Neve|http://www.cafeneve.com}} - Montreal, CA
    - {{Sextant Coffee Roasters|https://sextantcoffee.com}} - San Francisco, CA, US

Flour

It also has high levels of fat, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine (a form of vitamin b6) and beta-carotene, making it more nutritious than other kinds of grains. Another great thing about einkorn is that it isn't as toxic to people on gluten-free diets, it as yet to be proven but it should definitely be looked into!
