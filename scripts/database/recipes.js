  DESC
    & {*Seitan*} (say-tan) or {*wheat meat*}, can be made into a variety of meat-like foods using a variation of spices and other seasonings. It is the base of buddhist vegetarian cooking, and has been documented in China since the 6th century. It's an ingredient that is also present in japanese cuisine, for {*Shojin Ryori*} (vegetarian cooking) - an important term to remember if you don't eat meat and are traveling the country. Seitan takes on a different name there, it is known as {*Fu*}, and can be found in two forms, raw (nama-fu) or dry-baked (yaki-fu, which looks like bread). 
    % recipes/seitan.2.jpg
    & Seitan, or Fu, can be produced at home, but it's very labor intensive. Making it requires kneading wheat flour with water to rinse out the starch from the wheat, what remains is a sticky mass of pure gluten protein. If your plan is to make it from scratch, good on you; but otherwise, gluten flour (or vital wheat gluten) is your best bet. The basic ingredients for seitan are gluten flour and water, but it's best to flavour it with other ingredients - it is rather bland on its own. The amount of liquid that you use to make your dough will also affect the chewiness of your seitan, less waters means more chewy with a harder texture, and more will make it tender. 
    & In this recipe, I added chickpea flour for added nutrition. Wheat gluten proteins are deficient in lysine (an essential amino acid for good health), adding a lysine-rich food like chickpea flour to the mix makes up for this deficiency.
    % recipes/seitan.3.jpg
    & When preparing seitan, it's important to flavour the inside, and outside of the dough. Adding a variation of ingredients to the dough mix, like ginger, garlic, onion powder, tomato sauce, soy sauce etc. will make it extra flavourful, the same goes for the broth; adding vegetable broth and soy sauce as a base, and roughly chopped onions, garlic and ginger will season the outside of the dough. 
    & There are {*3 ways*} to cook seitan: {*boiling, steaming or baking*}. In this recipe, I used the boiling method. Steaming requires wrapping the dough in foil or some other wrapper to help it keep its shape, then, steaming it in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water for 30 minutes or so. Baking the seitan, means flattening or stretching the dough to fit the baking dish, adding seasonings overtop, and baking it for an hour. All methods are good, but some are better for certain kinds of meals. .

  INST
    MAIN
      - In a bowl, stir {#1/2 cup#} of {{gluten flour}} with {#1/4 cup#} of {{chickpea flour}}. 
      - In another bowl, mix {#1/3 cup#} of {{water}} (or vegetable broth) and {#1 tbsp#} of {{soy sauce}}. Pour into dry ingredients.
      - Knead for {#2-3 minutes#}. If dough is too sticky, add more flour. Let rest for 10 minutes, and knead for another set of 2-3 minutes. 
      - {_Separate dough in two_} - optional, but it creates more surface area that can inbibe flavour. Also, the seitan expands quite a bit and having smaller pieces makes it more manageable. 
    BROTH
      - Cut the following ingredients into smaller pieces: {#2 cloves#} of {{garlic}}, a {#1/2 large#} {{yellow onion}} and {#1 palm-sized knob#} of {{ginger}}. 
      - Add the cut ingredients to a pot, add {#3 cups#} of {{vegetable broth}} (or 1 tbsp of vegetable broth powder in 3 cups of water) and {#2 tbsp#} of {{soy sauce}}. Bring to a boil.
      - Add the seitan cutlets, reduce heat to low, and cover. 
      - Let the seitan simmer for {#1 hour#}.

    & I went all out this time, and used my fancy cookie cutters, but most times I just cut the sheets of dough into small squares with a regular knife. Using cookie cutters is longer, because I want to use every bit of the dough and that means re-using the bits around the cut outs.

  SERV : 2 loaves
  DESC
    & This black loaf of bread is what inspired this website. It took me a while to get my hands on bamboo charcoal powder, now that i have it, i will be baking a ton of these! Some months ago, I stumbled upon an image of an all-black loaf. I didn't know you could get bread to be that dark. 
    & Getting your hands on bamboo charcoal isn't easy. I saw stores on amazon.com that stocked it, but nothing in my area. I bought a small amount at a health food store where I live, but it was a very small jar (also crazy expensive). After much searching, I concluded that the best place to get it was in Japan. I assumed it would be relatively easy to get over there, wrong again. It's almost impossible to purchase in store, or maybe i wasn't taking to the right people, or going to the right places.
    % recipes/no.knead.black.bread.1.jpg
    & I finally found some available for purchase on amazon japan. Since i lived in temporary housing, shipping there wasn't ideal. Luckily, a good friend agreed to have it shipped to her place and it arrived before i left the country! That's how i got my hands on bamboo charcoal powder! Wasn't easy, but i got it from the best possible source! I got it through {{Taketora|http://www.taketora.co.jp}}, they've been growing and making things out of bamboo for years and years. They're true artisans.
    & Cooking with bamboo charcoal is a breeze, you don't need to add much to make your food black. It doesn't add taste to a recipe either, it's purely aesthetic. None that {*Bamboo charcoal*} binds on the nutrients in food that you're meant to be digesting, so it's preferable to not add bamboo charcoal to every food you make. Use it sparingly, as an occasional treat. 
  INST
    Preparation
      - In a bowl, mix in {#3 cups#} of {{all purpose flour}}, {#2 tbsp#} of {{bamboo charcoal powder}}, {#1 tsp#} of {{salt}} and {#1/2 tsp#} of {{active dry yeast}}. Mix well, your dough should turn a light grey colour. When you add water it will darken.
      - Add the {#1 1/2 cups#} of {{water}} gradually, stirring it with a spoon into a relatively cohesive dough. The dough will be very wet, no need to add extra flour.
      - Put a bag over the bowl, and let the dough rest {#anywhere from 9 to 24 hours#}. Ideally, prepare the dough late evening and let it rest overnight, you don't need to do anything to it. 
      - The next morning, remove the bag and place the dough on a lightly floured surface. {_Shape the dough into a ball_}. If too wet to handle, put some flour on your hands. You can make either one large loaf or two small ones with this recipe, i like to make two. Cover with a bag, or towel.
      - Pre-heat your oven to {#450F#}, and place your bread pan - or dutch oven - in it. Once it's done pre-heating, take out the pan and put your dough inside, sprinkle some {{poppy seeds}} (optional, but damn gorgeous) and press lightly to get them to stick. 
      - Cover the bread pan with aluminum foil (or matching lid) and put it back in the oven for {#30 minutes#}.
      - After 30 minutes, take the foil (or lid) off and let it cook for {#another 7 minutes#} or so.

    & Black pasta is visually striking. I remember the first time I saw it on a shelf in a grocery store, ever since then, I've been dying to make my own - happy to say that i can finally cross that off my list!
    & Making fresh pasta at home is easy. It doesn't require a lot of preparation, it's something you can do on a weekend. Kneading dough is relaxing. Just put some music on, pour yourself a glass of wine and start cooking! It's something you can do by yourself, but it's cool to do with a friend. Me and Devine made these while our friend Max was around.
    & The secret ingredient to making black pasta, is {*Bamboo Charcoal powder*}. It's seldomly used to make pasta, most of the time people will use squid ink. While harder to find, it works better in pasta as it will not alter the taste or smell of your dough. You can also make black pasta with black rice, although the consistency and ingredients are very different.
    % recipes/black.pasta.1.jpg
    & To make pasta, I use a pasta machine but you can easily do it by hand, using just a rolling pin and a knife. I've made pasta using both methods, it's good to try by hand first. Your first batch may not be perfect, but that's ok! You'll only get better with practice! 
    & NOTE: {*Bamboo charcoal*} binds on the nutrients in food that you're meant to be digesting, so it's preferable to not add bamboo charcoal to every food you make. Use it sparingly, as an occasional treat.
  INST
    Preparing the dough
      - Mix {#2 cups#} of {{wheat semolina}}, {#3/4 cup#} {{whole wheat flour}} and {#1 tbsp#} of {{bamboo charcoal powder}} in a bowl. 
      - Prepare a bowl of {{water}}, keep it close by. Add water to the flour mix gradually, one tablespoon at a time.
      - Keep adding water until your dough comes together. Your dough should be moist, but not too sticky. Add more water if needed.
      - Knead until your dough is smooth, then {_form into a ball_}. Cut your dough into quarters. Cover, and let it rest for {#30 minutes#}. 
    With pasta machine
      - Roll out the dough to your desired thickness using your pasta machine. {_Run the dough about 5-6 times_}, running it over the largest setting first, and then working your way down to a thinner setting. I went a knotch before the thinnest setting.
      - Once your dough is nice and flat, dust it with some extra flour and run it through the linguini or spaghetti setting. If you don't use enough flour, your dough may stick inside the mechanism of your pasta machine and will make the process difficult. You can catch the noodles that are coming out with a chopstick, this will keep them from trying to stick together. 
      - If your dough still feels moist, add more flour. If they're too moist they will stick together, we don't want this. Once they've been dusted with enough flour, {_separate into 6 portions_} and fold each one over itself once, and then again to make a small bundle. 
      - Let dry for {#30 minutes#}.
    Using a rolling pin
      - Roll out each quarter of dough to your desired thickness. Sprinkle extra flour if dough sticks to your rolling pin.
      - Fold each pasta sheet over itself a few times, again dusting it with enough flour so it doesn't stick. Folding makes it easier to cut, and your noodles will be more even as a result.
      - Make wider cuts for linguini, thinner for spaghetti etc. If it's your first time making pasta by hand, make linguini. Making consistenly thin noodles is tough, i don't recommend it on your first try.
      - If your dough still feels moist, add more flour. If they're too moist they will stick together, we don't want this. Once they've been dusted with enough flour, separate into 6 portions and fold each one over itself once, and then again to make a small bundle.
      - Let dry for {#30 minutes#}.
    Boiling
      - If you want to have your fresh pasta right away, bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook for approximately {#3 minutes#}, fresh pasta cooks a lot faster than the dry kind. 
    Freezing
      - Transfer to a freezer bag. I like to use little pieces of parchment paper to keep the fresh pasta bundles separated.

    & Using oats for bulk is a great, and healthier alternative to flour (plus it's hard to mess up.) Failing at food is the worse. I can never bring myself to throw it away. It feels like a waste to trash it, so what happens is I end up storing it in the back of the fridge. In refrigerators, unlike on school buses, the cool kids don't hang out in the back.

DARK YAKI GYOZA

    & Late night gyoza at izakaya, is one of the things i miss the most about living in Tokyo - maybe not one of the healthiest late night eats, but a DELICIOUS one. These are very unconventional gyoza, black on the outside, and red and orange on the inside.
    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.1.jpg
    & We made homemade gyoza dough with some friends a few weeks back, and it took FOREVER. Devine had the amazing idea of using our pasta maker to do it. We still needed to do a bit of kneading, to get it through the machine the first time. After that, it's easy and sweat-free!
    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.2.jpg
    & We didn't have any round cookie cutters, the last time we tried I was using upside down glasses. Didn't work well because the rims aren't sharp and smooshes the dough down instead. Again, Devine had a stroke of genius: Cans! I had an empty chickpea pan lying around, it was about the size of a gyoza wrapper so we used that to poke holes through the dough. Genius right?
    & I know not everyone has a pasta maker, you don't need one to make wrappers. You can just use a rolling pin.
    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.3.jpg
    & The fillings was another experiment, since i like to cook with colours in mind, i wanted something that would contrast the black. Beet and carrots seemed like an obvious choice. Unconventional, as far as traditional japanese gyozas go, but very delicious and very beautiful.
    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.4.jpg
    & We had a lot of fun making these gyoza, it's best made and eaten with friends!
    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.5.jpg
    & Gyoza wrapper techniques and ratios were based on the recipe from {{Just one cookbook|http://www.justonecookbook.com/recipes/gyoza-wrappers/}}. She explains it really well too on her blog it's worth taking a look. I learned a lot from her even if our techniques differ slightly. While I preferred not to knead by hand, or with a rolling pin, i did do it her way the first time.
    & NOTE: Bamboo charcoal binds on the nutrients in food that you're meant to be digesting, so it's preferable to not add bamboo charcoal to every food you make. Use it sparingly, as an occasional treat. 
  INST
    Dough
      - Mix {#2 cups#} of {{all purpose flour}} with {#1 tsp#} of {{bamboo charcoal powder}} in a bowl.
      - Dissolve {#1/2 tsp#} of {{salt}} in {#1/2 cup#} of {{just-boiled water}}, and pour into the flour little by little while mixing.
      - Knead the dough on a clean flat surface for a few minutes until it becomes smooth. If your dough is too dry, add 1 tbsp of hot water and repeat as needed.
      - {_Separate the dough in 3_}. Roll into balls and wrap them up with a bag or place in a lidded bowl, refrigerate for at least {#30 minutes#}. Leaving it to rest in the refrigerator makes the dough easier to manipulate afterwards.
      - Flatten each piece out with a rolling pin into a rough rectangle, thin enough so that you can run it through the pasta maker. Pass it through your pasta maker a few times, incrementing down to the thinnest setting gradually. You can use a rolling pin instead, it works but it takes a lot more effort. Both techniques work, this one just happens to be quicker and easier on your body. Note that depending on your pasta maker, the dough will come out a bit thicker than a traditional gyoza. If you want it thinner you can flatten it a bit more with a rolling pin.
      - Put the thin sheet of dough onto a clean flat surface. Take a can (with about a 3" diameter) and start to poke holes into it, these are your gyoza wrappers! You can use cookie cutters if you have some. I used an old chickpea can I had.
      - Pile the wrappers, sprinkle some {{cornstarch}} (or potato starch) inbetween each piece so they don't stick together. Put a damp towel over your wrappers so they don't dry out.
      - Repeat this process for the other 2 portions of dough, and you can re-use the scraps and make new dough to run through the pasta maker (no waste~). 
    Carrot filling
      - Mix the {#1/4 block#} of {{tofu}}, the {#1/3 cup#} of {{coriander}}, the {{2 grated carrots}} and the {#1 tsp#} of {{ginger root}} together in a bowl. Add {#1 tbsp#} of {{soy sauce}} as well as {{black pepper}} and {{salt}} to taste. Mix once more.

      - Mix the {#1/4 block#} of {{tofu}}, the {#1/3 cup#} of {{coriander}}, {#1 grated#} {{red beet}}, {{2 garlic cloves}} and {#1 tsp#} of {{ginger root}}. Add {#1 tbsp#} of {{soy sauce}} and some {{ground sichuan peppercorns}}. 
    Cooking
      - Take 1 wrapper, wet all around the edge with water using your fingers. <Keep a bowl of water close to dip your fingers in.
      - Put a spoonful of filling in the middle (carrot or beet).
      - Close it. Make little folds with the flap that is facing you using both hands, leaving the back part smooth. Make sure it's sealed tight. Repeat for the rest of the gyoza skins, alternate between fillings. Cover with a damp towel while you work so they don't dry up.
      - Put some vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat. Add gyoza in 2 rows of 3 in the pan. Cook until bottom becomes golden.
      - Add {#1/3 cup#} of {{water}} and put a lid on. Let steam until all the water evaporates. 
      - Add a bit of {{sesame oil}} and cook until crispy. Serve with a dipping sauce!

    & I baked a similar bread for my dad a few weeks ago. He's truly the best dad. Whenever me or my sisters ask for help, he always says yes. No hesitation, ever. He wouldn't ever think of refusing, the thought probably never even crosses his mind. Can't say how thankful I am to have someone like that in my life. Because of everything he does for me, once in a while I bring him some raisin bread.

    & If like my dad you like raisin bread, you will love this sweet raisin beet bread. It's halfway between a cake and bread. Adapted from one of my mom's old cookbook by Margo Oliver {*les menus de margo oliver*}. 
    & It's simple to make, and you can replace the raisins for cranberries or even chocolate chips for a different taste! If you make my recipe, just be sure to add plenty of raisins on top! I emptied a bag on it, without regret. They'll get super crispy, and will develop a sweet crispy caramelized taste. Was hard to keep myself from picking them off, Devine hates it when I do that.

This summer i decided to make it myself.

    & I've been looking for ways to incorporate persimmon into savoury recipes. I always thought it could make a great sauce for pasta or rice meals. If pureed, it will taste very sweet, but if you mix in curry powder and other spices and ingredients it becomes less of a dessert. 
    & Be careful when selecting your persimmon, there are two varieties. Hachiya persimmon are more elongated and you need to wait for it to soften down before attempting to eat it. Fuyu persimmon, have a tomato-like shape and you can eat it like an apple. 
    & There are many different varieties of curry powders it's just a pre-mixed combination of different ground spices. If you're in a hurry, buying a mix is best. But if you have a full stocked spice rack, it may be better and more fun to do it yourself. Typically curry mixes have turmeric, coriander, cumin, black and red pepper, cinnamon cloves, fennel seeds, cardamom, ginger and fenugreek. There can be as much as 20 different spices, but you can probably omit a few and it'll still taste pretty great.

    & I hardly ever bake cakes, this was my first proper cake. My sister's birthday was coming up, and my parents wanted to get her a themed cake. Of what you ask?
    & Something old. Something new. Something borrowed...
    & Something blue!
    & You guessed correctly, you wonderful nerd you! A tardis!
    % recipes/simple.doctor.who.cake.1.jpg
    & They asked for a quote from their favourite bakery, they do great work but were charging a too much for it. So my parents turned to me, and my cake-baking adventure began!
    & My sister loves lemon cake, that part is simple. Getting the cake to be tardis blue though, is another matter entirely. That colour is unnatural, those royal blue 'raw blueberry pinterest cakes' are complete bull (they really, really are). I had to use food colouring, it's not ideal but it was necessary to get that tardis blue. I went ahead and bought Wilton's royal blue and violet colouring to mix, to get it be that specific shade. Using royal blue alone would have made it go turquoise.
    & The cake noob that i am, I searched around and found a very awesome {{Lemon cake recipe|http://thegreenforks.com/vegan-birthday-cake}} by Laura, author of The Green forks. I adapted her recipe, and it turned out perfect. I referenced her cake batter recipe, while the tofu lemon curd filling was inspired by {{Zena chews|http://www.culinate.com/recipes/collections/Contributors/Zena+Chew/vegan_lemon_layer_cake}}. Couldn't have done it without their recipes, thanks girls.

    & I didn't want to make an overly sweet cake, so i decided to not add frosting. Opted for a 'powdered sugar-dusted' cake. Most Tardis cakes on the internet are made with fondant, and thusly taste like liquid unicorn. I don't have the tastebuds of a 5 years old, can't deal with that level of sweet. I have no interest in tasting the rainbow.
    & I wanted to make a minimalistic and simple lemon cake. Then came the image of the tardis drifting through space. That image was simple, evocative. So i cut out a tardis stencil and added powdered sugar! Voila! My sister had a vegan lemon birthday cake! This cake is a safe bet, even for non-vegans. Even my parents, who dislike tofu, really enjoyed it!

    Tardis stencil
      - Print out the image in the correct dimensions for the cake, i used an image of the tardis that i found online.
      - With a fine cutting tool cut out the shape, I didn't take a photo that had lettering, the detail is just too fine. Besides, there is enough information that will make it obvious that it's a tardis. Be sure to cut out the windows, that detail is key.
    Cake
      - Pre-heat oven at {#350F#}.
      - {_Grease two 8" cake pans_}, set aside.
      - In a bowl mix {#2 1/4 cups#} of {{all purpose flour}}, {#1 1/2 cups#} of {{sugar}}, 3/4 tsp of baking soda and 3/4 tsp of salt.
      - In a separate bowl, stir {#1 1/2 cups#} of {{cold water}} with {#3/4 cup#} of {{canola oil}}, {#1 tbsp#} of {{vanilla extract}}, {#3 tbsp#} of {{lemon juice}} and {#1 tsp#} of {{lemon zest}}.
      - Combine wet ingredients with the dry, mix well. Stir in {#1 tsp#} of {{royal blue food colouring#} with {#1 drop#} of {{violet food colouring}}.
      - Pour cake batter into pans, at the {#30 minute mark#}, insert a toothpick in the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's ready! Otherwise bake for an additional {#5 minutes#}.
      - Let cool. Slice part of the curved top off of one of the cakes to even it out (and eat it, because you wont need it). Brush top of trimmed cake with a generous serving of the {{tofu lemon curd}}, place second cake layer over it and press down gently.
      - Place tardis stencil over the cake 
      - Make sure the top is completely dry, put some {{powdered sugar}} in a sifter or fine mesh strainer. Hold over the cake and gently shake it onto the cake until it's covered to your liking. Make sure to put enough around the stencil so the shapes comes out nicely. Remove stencil gently.
      - If you want, you can sprinkle a bit of turmeric to make a glowey area atop of the tardis. Or use something else that is yellow!

    & Introducing, my basic black bread recipe. This bread is super light and fluffy, it's great great for morning toast or sandwiches.
    & I've been reading up a lot about bread, there's so many kinds out there. I wanted to understand how the ingredients we add, can change the texture of the bread. Also read about the differences in temperature, to knead or not to knead etc. 
    & Truth is, it depends on the type of bread you want.
    % recipes/basic.black.bread.1.jpg
    & I wanted to make a sandwich bread with a light crumb, the kind that bounces back when touched.
    & The one I made this time has more fat, which in turn makes it softer and fluffier. The fat that you use will also change the texture/taste of the bread. A lot of people wont like the idea of adding 'fat' to a recipe, know that fat isn't synonymous with unhealthy. Too much of it can be bad, but in moderation there really isn't anything to worry about. It also depends on what fat you choose, there are good and bad kinds of fat. 
    & There are many things you can do to help soften your bread, like brushing the outside with a little oil or fat. Do this as soon as you take it out of the oven, it will make the outside less crunchy. You can also substitute nut milk for the water, if you want a richer taste. There are so many different things to think about when baking!
    & I made this loaf for a brunch I had with friends, we wanted to have fondue with a set I got as a gift during the holidays. We  cut the loaf into cubes, and dunked them in! Soft bread is perfect for fondue!

      - Add {#1 tbsp#} of {{vegan butter}} (earth balance) to the water mix, then stir in {#1/2 cup#} of the flour mix with a wooden spoon. Keep adding flour a {#1/2 cup#} at a time, until the dough stops sticking to the sides. 
      - Put ball of dough on lightly floured counter-top and start kneading, add a bit of flour everytime it starts to stick to your hands. Knead for {#15 minutes#}. You may not use up all of your flour, if there's still a lot left and your dough is nice smooth don't add any more. Don't want to risk drying it out.
      - Heat up oven at the very lowest setting. This will be our warm place for bread rising. 
      - Grease up a bowl and put the dough, rolling it once to cover all sides. Cover with a cloth and place in oven. {_Let rise for 45 minutes_}.
      - Your bread should have doubled in size. Take bread out of oven, knead a few times and shape into a 10-11 inch cigar-shape. Sprinkle some {{corn semolina}} on a baking sheet and place bread on top - this will keep it from sticking. Slash the top of the bread in the middle with a knife, doing this will keep the ends of the bread from splitting. Mist top of bread lightly with {{water}}, then add {{white sesame seeds}}. Press lightly to make them stick. Cover loaf with a cloth, put back in oven to rise for an additional {#45 minutes#}. If you don't want a traditional bread shape, put bread in a greased loaf pan to rise.
      - Turn oven up to {#350F#} . Bake for {{30 minutes}}, or until it sounds hollow when tapped at the bottom.
      - Brush sides lightly with {{coconut oil}}, then let cool on a pile of towels or a cooling rack if you have one.
    Burger buns
      - Repeat steps 1 to 6.
      - Instead of forming into a 'cigar' shape at step 7, {_divide into 8 pieces_} and shape into a tight ball. Sprinkle baking sheet with some {{corn semolina}} and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another 45 minutes in the warmed oven.
      - Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with {{vegan butter}} and put {{white sesame seeds}} on top. Bake uncovered for {#20 minutes#} at {#350F#}.
      - Let cool on a pile of towels or cooling rack.
    Hot dog buns
      - Repeat steps 1 to 6. {_Divide through into 15 pieces_} and shape into small cylinders (or general elongated hot dog shape). Sprinkle baking sheet with some {{corn semolina}} and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another {#45 minutes#} in the warmed oven.
      - Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with {{vegan butter}}. Bake uncovered for {#20 minutes#} at {#350F#}.

SHICHIMI TOGARASHI CRACKERS

    & Japanese konbini always have a ton of fun flavours for crackers and chips. Anything with shiso, or ume flavoured are insta-buys for me. Stuff like that isn't as available in Montreal, but at least you can find other things like shichimi togarashi! 
    & Ume and shiso aren't anything like shichimi togarashi. Originally, i wanted to make senbei but since i recently purchased a bag of chickpea flour, i wanted to have a recipe using that. Senbei is typically made with rice flour and/or rice left-overs. I don't have rice left-overs on hand, we usually just eat it all on the same day. I never make extras.
    & When i decided i was going to make this, i didn't have any shichimi togarashi left, so I made my own! if you have a well-stocked spice rack, you can easily make it yourself. 'Shichimi togarashi' means '7-flavour chili pepper'. If you have some already at home just use that, but if you don't all you need is to grind these spices together - 
    & 2 tbsp chili flakes but if you don't all you need is to grind these together - 2 tbsp chili flakes 1 tbsp sanshou (sichuan peppercorns) 1 tbsp roasted orange peel 1 tbsp black sesame seeds 1 tbsp white sesame seeds 2 tsp ground ginger and 2 tbsp nori (or aonori).
    % recipes/shichimi.togarashi.crackers.2.jpg
    & Some people substitute sichuan peppercorns for black peppercorns, i don't reccommend doing that. They're not interchangeable, sichuan peppercorns is what makes it taste awesome. It's a numbing pepper, with a really distinctive taste and aroma. If you eat one peppercorn, you'll notice right away that it numbs your tongue and alters your sense of taste.

    & A few weeks ago, I asked people what they wanted to see me cook. Some asked for black gnocchi, so here they are! Made from scratch, beautiful and black. Topped with a light and sweet sauce, fresh scallions and daikon!
    & As it turns out, making gnocchi is long. It's well worth the effort, but if you're planning on making some, clear your afternoon or get a friend to help.
    % recipes/black.gnocchi.1.jpg
    & I started cooking these early in the day, around 9 in the morning. Every step takes time. You have to wait for the potatoes to bake, wait for them to cool down, you need to remove the skins etc. Skipping any of those steps will result in a gnocchi disaster, nothing worse than an uneatable meal. 
    & These turned out perfect! This is a large recipe, so if you're only two you'll have plenty left-over that you can let dry, freeze and eat later.
    % recipes/black.gnocchi.2.jpg
    & For the topping, I wanted a ton of scallions with mushrooms and seaweed. I miss the pasta in italian restaurants in japan, they always had some with japanese-style toppings. Since i'm currently on a shichimi togarashi binge, (left-over from my cracker recipe) I included some in this recipe as well.

    & Because the sauce and toppings are light and simple, you can focus on the texture of the gnocchi.

    Gnocchi
      - Preheat oven to 400F . Bake potatoes until fork tender. Peel skins off and mash them up with a fork or food processor. Let cool completely <small>You can also boil them until fork tender</small>
      - Sift 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 tbsp bamboo charcoal powder and 1 pinch of sea salt together in a bowl.
      - Mix in the potatoes gradually, knead until you get a consistent dough. <small>You may not need to use all of the potatoes, rarely are potatoes the exact same size. If the dough feels ok stop mixing in extra potatoes</small>
      - Put a bit of flour on your working surface and divide your ball of dough into 4, roll each section into a long rope with an approximate 2cm diameter.
      - Proceed to cutting up the ropes into 2cm sections. To make the little lines over the gnocchis, take each piece and make a ball with it. Press it up against the backside of a fork and slide it down all the way to the ends with your finger. Your ball will be left with sets of lines on top and will take its signature elongated shape.
      - Cook gnocchi in a pot of boiling water with a bit of sea salt, the bits that are ready will float back to the surface.
    Sauce
      - Rehydrate 1/2 a cup's worth of shiitake mushrooms in a cup of boiling water. When shiitake are soft, remove the tails and cut into slices.
      - Rehydrate wakame as well in a separate cup. Let stand for 5 minutes, drain, rinse and cut into smaller pieces.
      - Chop up 5 scallions and grate 1/3 cup's worth of daikon. Squeeze water out of daikon and set aside.
      - Mix 6 tbsp of soy sauce, 3 tbsp of mirin and 4 tsp of sugar in a bowl.
      - When Gnocchi are ready, sauté in a pan with the sauce and shiitake. Serve them into bowls and top first with wakame, scallions and then a dollop of grated daikon. Sprinkle some shichimi togarashi on top!

    & To prepare this recipe, wash the beets and cut them into wedges. Toss them with a bit of oil and herbs bake them in the oven for 40 minutes. It's that simple! If they're organic, you can keep the skins on, otherwise peeling them is better.

      - Put 1 tbsp of coconut sugar into a bowl with 1 cup of warm water, sprinkle 2 tsp of active dry yeast. Let foam for 5 minutes. 
      - Mix in 1/2 tsp of salt, the beet puree as well as 2 cups of all purpose flour. Stir until the dough doesn't stick to the sides of the bowl. Transfer dough to a lightly floured working surface and continue to knead, adding more flour until you get a nice even dough that doesn't stick to your hands.
      - Form into a ball, put in a bowl greased with some vegan butter or olive oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
      - Punch down the dough and separate into 10 balls. Roll out the balls into 8" long ropes and prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Shape the ropes into hearts directly onto your baking sheet, we want to move them as little as possible to avoid distorting the shapes. Pinch the ends of each heart together carefully. Cover with a clean dishcloth and let rise for an additional 20 minutes.
      - While dough is resting, preheat oven to 400F . Fill a large pot with water, bring to a boil.
      - Pick up each heart carefully and drop into the boiling water for 30 seconds. Pull out out the bagel with a slotted spoon and let drawin over a set of paper towels.
      - Transfer the boiled bagels back onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops with a mixture of 1 tbsp of soy milk and 1 tbsp of maple syrup and sprinkle some poppy seeds over each one.

    & Yellow on black, needed to make it happen.
    & Burmese tofu is not really tofu, i know, that's confusing. At first, i thought it was tofu blended with turmeric. It has a yellow tint, and it's because Burmese tofu is chickpea based! The cool thing about it, is that it takes 10 minutes to make and sets 1 hour. It's a great soy-free alternative, and the texture is comparable to that of silken tofu.

      - Mix 1 cup of chickpea flour with 1/4 tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp of ground turmeric. Add an additional 1 1/2 cups of vegetable bouillon, and stir until the mixture is lump-free.
      - Lower to medium heat, and pour in chickpea batter. Whisk continuously for 5-10 minutes, until thickened. Pour into a 8x8 baking dish lined with parchment paper. Smooth out top with the back of a spoon.
      - Let cool and set for 1 hour, then refrigerate for a little while longer before cutting. This will give the 'tofu' time to set. Cut into 12 pieces, and then cut in 2 again lenghtwise to make them fit over nigiri. 
      - Preheat oven to 350F.
      - Line backing sheet with aluminium foil, line up pieces of chickpea tofu. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, brush chickpea tofu with unagi sauce and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
    Combine
      - Shape tablespoons of black rice into oblongs, smear tops with a bit of wasabi, lay a nori strip texture-side up, place strip of chickpea tofu as well as the rice ball (wasabi side facing downwards) and finally fold nori over bottom of rice (cut off excess, you can wet the edges with a bit of water if ever it isn't sticking). Makes about 12 nigiri. <small>If you have nigiri molds, shaping the rice into ovals will be very easy. Otherwise use your hands, keep them moist so the rice doesn't stick. </small>

    & Black sesame rice pancakes, with a generous dollop of mango. Because sometimes, we all need a break from maple syrup. Okay, i hear you, no we don't - but here's something different anyway! 
    & Made matcha rice pancakes for Devine a few days ago, since I made a double recipe we ended up having left-over batter. It doesn't keep well, so we ate it that same night. I paired the remaining 2 pancakes with a bit of fresh mango and MAN! It tastes so damn GOOD together!
    & I made it into a recipe, but used ground black sesame instead of matcha. The nutty taste of sesame paired with mango is perfect. Dressing pancakes with maple syrup is fine, but the sugar high i get after is not. I feel like my heart is going to burst out of my chest, 'alien-style'.
    & No one likes that, i'd like my innards to stay where they are thank you!

    Pancake
      - Heat 1/4 cup of black sesame seeds, in a non-stick pan at medium heat. Remove once they start to pop. Let cool, then crush into a powder with a mortar and pestle. 
      - Mix 1 1/4 cup of soy milk, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of ground black sesame seeds. Blend, until you get a smooth grey liquid. 
      - Mix 1 cup of rice flour, 1/4 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tbsp of whole cane sugar together. Pour wet ingredients into the dry ones, and mix until smooth, make it as lump-free as you can.
      - Heat up non-stick pan at medium heat, spoon a portion of batter into it. Flip once the bottoms have browned, and little bubbles appear at the top.

    & As much as i love pasta, i like to vary my food a lot day to day. Once in a while, I like to make zucchini noodles! They're ready in an instant, and are delicious when topped with a two-mushroom velouté sauce. This meal is also green on green, most of the ingredients are different shades of the same colour. 
    & Yes, those are the sort of details that I care about.
    & What green things can i add to this? Wakame! I don't always have fresh greens in my fridge, when i don't, I use wakame. It's handy to have around, it keeps for a long time and doesn't require a lot of prep. Wakame is also a good source of Iodine, essential for health.
    % recipes/mushroom.zucchini.pasta.1.jpg
    & Edamame is another green food that I like. I have the frozen, de-shelled kind in my fridge. It saves a lot of time. 
    & Mushrooms aren't green but they do add a TON of flavour to sauces. Shiitake mushrooms have a lot of flavour, shimeji mushrooms have a subtle taste but look nice in a dish.
    % recipes/mushroom.zucchini.pasta.2.jpg
    & You can make this recipe using regular pasta, but it wont be green... unless you use spinach pasta (which could look good too.) Or matcha pasta? A really awesome girl on twitter made some using my black pasta recipe as a base, they look gorgeous!
    & Hope you like the recipe, happy cooking!
  INST
    Preparation
      - Rehydrate 2 tbsp of wakame in water, drain and set aside.
      - Cut stems off of 1/4 cup of shiitake mushrooms, rehydrate by pouring boiling water over them. Keep them submerged for 30 min, or up to 1 hour. <small>It's better to rehydrate them overnight, for a minimum of 8 hours. The flavour will be stronger, if you're in a rush, boiling water is fine. If you have fresh shiitake, you can also skip this step</small>
      - Cut 4 medium-sized zucchinis thinly using a julienne peeler (or spiralizer), place in bowls. <small>I don't always cook my zucchini, but if you prefer a warm version sauté them in a pan.</small>
      - Put 2 tbsp of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, whisk in 2 tbsp of all purpose flour. Stir until it's completely absorbed by the oil. Let roux cook for a minute or so.
      - Stir in 2 cups of vegetable bouillon, bring heat up to a boil and then lower to a simmer. Add a 1/4 cup of shiitake mushrooms, a 1/4 cup of shimeji mushrooms and a 1/3 cup of edamame to the sauce. Let cook for 10 minutes, season sauce with sea salt and black pepper. Add the wakame re-hydrated wakame. Serve over zucchini pasta, and season with shijimi togarashi!

    & Whenever i ask Devine what he wants to eat, he'll always say pasta. I don't always say yes to this, not unless i want to eat pasta everyday. Secondly, he'll ask for Pâté Chinois. It's always hard for me to say no to, so i succumb, peek into the fridge and see what variation of it i can make. It's a super versatile dish, my recipe has layers consisting of tofu and burmese tofu, green peas, sweet potato and cauliflower.
    % recipes/pate.chinois.1.jpg
    & Pâté Chinois is very much like Shepherd's pie, which is why i will use these 2 terms interchangeably in this recipe. My mom made this all the time when i was a kid, she would make the traditional meat version, with corn and all. My meals are always meatless, but it has the same general idea. This dish inspires the same kind of comfort.
    % recipes/pate.chinois.2.jpg
    & I've made versions of this dish with just cauliflower, or just using tofu, or just potatoes too. I've made it so often, i've gone through every possibility. This Pâté Chinois happened because me and Devine both wanted different things.
    & I wanted cauliflower... 
    & ...he wanted sweet potato. 
    & I wanted burmese tofu...
    & ...he wanted tofu.
    % recipes/pate.chinois.3.jpg
    & So what did we do? We combined it all so both of us will get what we want! Ever since i discovered <a href=\"http://grimgrains.com/sweet+mock+eel+nigiri\">burmese tofu</a> i've been making it regularly, so it's simple for me to add it to recipes. If you don't have time to make it (it only takes 15 minute of active prep time), just using tofu alone will be delicious.
    &Hope you like this recipe!
  INST
    Preparation
      - Preheat oven to 375F.
      - Bring a pot of water (or vegetable bouillon for added flavour) to a boil, cook 1, cubed, large sweet potato as well as 1 cup of chopped white cauliflower florets until tender. Drain, mix with 1 tsp of smoked paprika and puree with an immersion blender. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Set aside.
      - Take 1/2 a block of firm tofu, and mash it down using a fork or just using your hands. I just squish it with my fingers to get a crumbly texture. Do the same for 1 cup of burmese tofu, mash it down and mix it with the tofu. <small>You can see my other recipe to find out how to make burmese tofu, alternatively you can just use 1 whole block of tofu instead.</small>
      - In a large pan, brown the yellow onion with a bit of oil. Add the tofu/burmese tofu, add 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 drop of liquid smoke. Cook for a few minutes. Season with black pepper and sea salt. Press into bottom of a 8x8 baking dish.
      - Cover with the contents of 1 can of unsalted green peas (reserve a few for the top) and with the pureed cauliflower/sweet potato. Smooth with a spatula, decorate with some green peas and sprinkle with smoked paprika.
      - Bake for 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Let cool, serve with some sambal oelek or some other spicy condiment!

    & It's Macaroni and Cheese week in Montreal, as good a reason as any to make some at home. My mac n 'cheese' has whole grain macaroni noodles, served with a faux-cheese consisting of golden beets, roasted red peppers, nutritional yeast and other delicious ingredients. Also, topped with some roasted green chiles for a bit of a kick!
    & I've been experimenting a lot with faux-cheeses recently, my choices are somewhat limited because of my nut allergy. But it's all good, having limitations just means i need to get more creative! Everyday, i try and think of alternatives to things i used to eat, like cheese. I also like to find alternatives to things i like, like swapping out rice for cauliflower.
    % recipes/green.chile.mac.n.cheese.1.jpg
    & I've seen many great 'faux-cheese' recipes online, even some nut-free ones (so thankful for those). One of the inspirations for this recipe, was the awesome lady from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7-RgLABm_U&index=5&list=FLB9JN60Dbk3ob18wRs-upwA\">Cooking with plants</a>. Would have never thought of adding red peppers to a faux-cheese. She uses a marinated kind, but using a fresh oven-roasted pepper is fine. 
    & For the faux-cheese sauce, i was going to use potatoes to make it more 'creamy'. I went to get the ingredients i needed for the recipe at the grocery, and i saw some golden beets on sale. Golden beets, being yellow, i thought wouldn't alter the colour of the sauce and it would be a nice alternative to potatoes.

    & Making brownies has been on my mind for some time, i finally settled for spicy brownies, with sweet and spicy pomegranate syrup!
    & It took me a LONG time to decide on a mix of ingredients/flavours; I've had recipe notes lying around on my desktop for ages now, with ingredients added, or scratched off.
    & I would still be in brownie rut, if it hadn't been for Devine ; his birthday was coming up, when I asked him what he wanted as a dessert he said, 'BROWNIES!'
    & The recipe was adapted from Joanne Gallagher's fantastic blog, <a href=\"http://www.inspiredtaste.net/24412/cocoa-brownies-recipe/\">Inspired taste</a>. I'm not good enough  to freestyle brownies, using her recipe as a base - for quantities especially - helped me out a lot. At least, i can get a good idea of how many wet, fat and sweet elements I need.
    % recipes/chili.pomegranate.brownies.1.jpg
    & Spent time thinking about what i wanted it to look like, and how i wanted to present it. I didn't a chocolate topping - i've never been a fan of double-chocolate anything. I, at least, knew i wanted a fruit topping. 
    & I wanted to make the brownies in a round cake pan, and decorate it with powdered sugar patterns, using stencils. Then, I stumbled upon a recipe online for a fish-based dish (they used a pomegranate syrup as garnish.) I'd never made syrup before, but i knew that's what i wanted as a coulis over my brownies.
    & I scrapped the round cake pan idea, as well as the powdered sugar. Devine's birthday brownies were going to be topped with fresh pomegranate seeds, and a pomegranate syrup coulis!
    & Again, something was missing...
    & I had some really good, spicy chocolate fleur de sel cookies at my old studio. The idea of putting chili peppers in cookies (or cake) had never ocurred to me before. I thought it was brilliant - and the chocolate and chili mix is just insane (in a good way.) Lindt makes dark chocolate with chili peppers, I guess it was inspired by those 2 things.
    % recipes/chili.pomegranate.brownies.2.jpg
    & I put a LOT of chili pepper flakes in these, i have a higher tolerance to it but if you don't feel free to use less. The syrup has a fair amount in it too, if you're worried about the level of spicy, you can actually not put it in the brownie batter. But, be sure to infuse it in the pomegranate syrup, won't be the same without it.
    & These were a big success, Devine loved them! I cut them into 24 small squares, but feel free to make larger blocks. Smaller portions means you can have some longer, i like that idea.
    & In this recipe I substituted half of the fat for pureed pumpkin. In brownies you can only substitute half the amount, before it effects the texture. Hope you like it! 
  INST
    Preparation
      - Preheat oven to 325F.
      - Cut 1/3 cup's worth of pumpkin, steam until softened and process into a puree with an immersion blender.
      - Put 3 tbsp of ground flax seeds in a bowl with 9 tbsp water, let thicken for 5 minutes. Set aside.
      - Put 5 tbsp of vegan butter, 5 tbsp of pumpkin puree, 3/4 cup whole cane sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder and a 1/4 tsp sea salt in a pan over medium to low heat. Stir until the butter is melted, and all is well mixed.
      - Stir in the flax 'eggs', as well as the 2 tbsp of red pepper flakes and 1 tsp of cayenne powder. Add 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, mixing vigorously. Mixture should be very thick, but if it doesn't pour easily, mix in water 1 tbsp at a time until it's at the right consistency. 
      - Pour into a 8X8 baking dish lined with parchment papper, flatten with the back of a spoon to even it out. Bake for 25 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool. Cut in 24 small squares.
    Syrup
      - Put 2 cups of unsweetened pomegranate juice into a pot with 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp cayenne. Bring to a boil, lower to medium-high heat and leave for up to 1h or until liquid has been reduced to 1 cup.
      - Let cool, the syrup will thicken when cooled. Top brownies with fresh pomegranate seeds, and drizzle with the chili-infused syrup!

      - Puree the roasted beets, 1 1/4 cup of chickpeas, the 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/4 cup tahini, 1/2 tsp of sea salt and 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar in a food processor or using an immersion blender. Mix in 2 tbsp of olive oil at the end. <small>If the hummus feels too thick, add a few tbsp of water until desired consistency</small>
    Tortillas
      - Put 3 cups of all purpose flour, 1 tsp bamboo powder and 1 tsp of sea salt in a bowl. Mix well.
      - Add 1/4 cup of olive oil and 3/4 cup of cold water, knead into a smooth dough. Separate into 11 balls, dust lightly with flour and let rest for 5 minutes. Roll out into circles. <small>Put the tortillas under a cloth until you're ready to cook them so they don't dry up</small>
      - Heat a non-stick pan at medium heat, cook tortillas for 30 seconds on each side. Again, put the warmed tortillas under a cloth so they stay nice and moist.
    Combine
      - Brush some beet hummus into a tortilla, add a bit of chopped black olives and some arugula overtop. Be sure to put the fillings near the edge to make it easier to roll.
      - Roll the tortillas tightly and then slice into bite-sized bits.

    & Black sesame ice cream bars, because it's starting to get warmer in Montreal! I want something sweet, nutty, refreshing and BLACK to eat! Need to goth-up my insides.
    & Ok, so it's not black. Grey is fine though, grey is gorgeous. There should be more, naturally grey, foods.
    & Making crusts is always an ordeal for me, most of the time i don't have the ingredients to make it. A lot of recipes call for graham crackers, or dates. While I often do have dates, i don't have an endless supply of it. Was wondering if there was something i could do with oats, i always have a TON of steel cut oats on hand.
    & I looked up recipes for oat-based crusts, and found this awesome one by <a href=\"http://www.oatmealwithafork.com/2014/11/14/5-ingredient-no-roll-pie-crust-gluten-free-nut-free/\">Lauren Goslin</a> from 'oatmeal with a fork'. Her recipe called for olive oil, but I swapped it for coconut oil. Coconut oil suits desserts perfectly, assuming you like the taste of coconut . The flavour can be pretty strong.
    % recipes/black.sesame.ice.cream.bars.1.jpg
    & As for the black sesame ice cream, this is actually my 3rd attempt. First one was good, made it with silken tofu and coconut milk. Didn't have any silken tofu left for this batch, so gave bananas a go, and it worked out great too! 
    & Being able to make black sesame ice cream at home makes me happy. Now that Japan is so far away, and that kombinis aren't 5 minutes away anymore. AH I miss the convenience of Kombinis.
  INST
    Crust
      - Preheat oven to 375F.
      - Put 1 1/2 cups of oat flour and 2 tbsp of sugar in a bowl. Mix well. Pour 1/4 cup of coconut oil and stir until the batter has a crumb-like texture. Stir in 4 tbsp of cold water to moisten it further. <small>you can make your own oat flour using steel cut oats by grinding them in a food processor or using an immersion blender.</small>
      - Spoon mixture into 4 mini loaf pans, flatten well with a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool. <small>I used mini kitchenaid silicone bread pans</small>
    Ice cream
      - Heat 2/3 cups of black sesame seeds in a pan at medium heat, once they start to pop remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to a food processor and grind into a fine powder.
      - Put in a blender with 1 can of coconut milk, 4 tbsp of sugar and 1 banana. Pulse until smooth.
      - Put pans into a tray, separate batter evenly overtop of the oat crust into the 4 mini pans. <small>The reason i placed them on a tray is so i dont have to handle the silicone bread pans individually, since the mold is soft it means it can 'twist' and cause the batter to spill on the sides of the oat crust. Isn't a big deal but the presentation isn't as pretty if you can't see the two layers</small>
      - Put in the freezer for 3 hours or so. Pop out of the molds and store in another container or eat and enjoy! <small>After spending a long time in the fridge the ice cream part will get pretty hard, you should take it out of the freezer 10 minutes before eating it. It'll be softer and easier to eat that way</small>
      - One bar can serve 2 people! Just slice in two! Serve with fresh fruit.

    & Black sesame chocolate cookies with a wasabi glaze? Yep, you heard right! 
    & A few days ago was 'international chocolate chip cookie day'. Apparently there's a day for everything? How annoying. It was hard to ignore, had images of cookies on my twitter feed all day. So despite today not being a day devoted to cookies, I decided to go ahead and make some anyway, because yolo.
    % recipes/wasabi.swirl.chocolate.cookies.1.jpg
    & I don't know if you guys ever had this, the 'wasabi flavoured chocolate' that Lindt makes. I had some for the first time a few years back. I was intrigued by it, it's a strange idea. If you're used to having wasabi with sushi, wasabi mixed into anything else just feels weird. Why would anyone want that in a dessert? Goes to show, that sometimes it's a good idea to play around with flavours. Mixing tastes you like together will not always yield good results, but in this case, it did.
    & I wanted to mix the wasabi directly in the cookies at first, but after reading a lot about baking with it, I decided to just apply it after in the form of a glaze. People were saying that the taste fades significantly when heated, didn't want that! Wanted a wasabi 'punch-in-the-face' taste.

      - Put 1/4 cup of black sesame seeds in a non-stick pan at medium heat, roast until they begin to pop. Let cool, mix with 2 tbsp soy yogurt and pulse in an immersion blender or mortar and pestle until smooth. <small>You can make your own quick soy yogurt or sour milk, add apple cider vinegar to soy milk 1 1/4 tbsp for every 1 1/4 cup of milk</small>
      - Add to the bowl with the flax seeds along with a 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 1/3 cup cane sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Stir well.
      - Take 1 1/2 cups of steel cut oats, break it down into 'coarse' flour with a food processor or with an immersion blender. Don't grind it too finely, having bigger bits gives an interesting texture to the cookie!
      - Add the dry ingredients one by one, mixing thoroughly in-between. Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of sea salt, 2 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder, the coarsely ground 'oat' flour as well as 2 tsp of soy milk 
      - Take 1 generous tbsp of cookie dough and form into a ball, put onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Flatten a bit with the palm of your hand. Bake for 13 minutes, let cool on the baking sheet for 10 min and then transfer to a cooling rack.

    & Fancy it up with some easy-to-prepare mango ice cream with black sesame syrup! Made using only 4 ingredients, for colour enthusiasts!
    & Internet is full of recipes using just fruit for ice cream, yep this recipe is one of 'those'. I've made ice cream with other bases, like banana or coconut milk. Both are good dairy-free alternatives. Full fat coconut milk is expensive, so i don't use it too often. You need it to be full fat, otherwise it wont freeze well. I learned it the hard way. Using just 1 fruit is nice, because of how little preparation is required. Whether you're using bananas, watermelon, strawberries... all you need to do is cut the fruit up into chunks, and freeze it for a few hours. Depending on the fruit, it may take longer. Also, if like me, you don't have a food processor, you can cut it up into smaller chunks to make it easier to break down with an immersion blender. 
    % recipes/mango.ice.cream.with.black.sesame.syrup.1.jpg
    & I like making syrups, or juice reductions a lot. It's simple, and you can use it in many other recipes afterwards! Reductions that aren't sweetened with sugar, you can use as add-on to sauces, or alone as a 'glaze'. My fridge has 3 different syrups in it right now.
    & 'What are those?' Devine would ask.
    & 'EXPERIMENTS' I would reply, wiggling my digits about, in a creepy fashion. 'You shall seeeee, oh yes, oh yes. YES. You shall seeee.'
    & I used a technique that Mike Case came up with on his blog <a href=\"https://discoginferno.wordpress.com/tag/sesame-seed-syrup/\">Disco Ginferno</a>, he made a white sesame syrup to use in cocktails! I liked not requiring a blender to make it, blending sesame seeds into a smooth liquid is hard. My immersion blender can't grind seeds finely. Boiling the seeds, and then straining them out is simple. And since you can re-use the seeds afterwards, there's no waste! The fact the seeds are toasted beforehand helps to bring out the nutty flavour, so whatever you do, don't skip that step!
  INST
    Preparation
      - Peel and cut 1 ripe mango into chunks, lay pieces over a plate lined with parchment paper. Put in the freezer for at least 2h. <small>I put parchment paper because sometimes the fruit will stick too much to the plate and is hard to remove</small> 
      - Put 1 cup of black sesame seeds in a pan, bring to medium heat and toast them until they start to pop.
      - In a pot combine 1 cup of water with the black sesame seeds. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 10-15 minutes.
      - Strain liquid from sesame seeds using a cheese cloth or with a mesh strainer, squeezing out as much liquid as you can. Reserve sesame seeds for later use. Return liquid to pot, add 1/2 cup of sugar and bring to medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat and let cool. 
      - Puree frozen mango using an immersion blender, separate in 2 bowls and serve with 2 tbsp of black sesame syrup and some black sesame seeds reserved from before. <small>Keep the sesame seeds! They're still good, you can use them in other dishes</small>

    & Summers in Montreal, go hand in hand with beer. There is such a wide variety of brews here. My corner store has a TON, most are made locally too. Me and Devine like craft beer a lot, hard to not drink everyday. To help satisfy our evergrowing craving, I decided to try and make hop flavoured ice cream!
    & Sweet and bitter! SUPER TASTY! Felt like I used just the right amount. This ice cream is definitely for people who love the smell and taste of hops (as well as cold summer dairy-free treats)!
    % recipes/hop.ice.cream.2.jpg
    & I wasn't sure how to 'infuse' the hops into the ice cream base, we tried making hop tea by infusing it overnight in the fridge, but the taste wasn't strong enough. Felt we would get better results and better flavour, if the hops were heated. The pouch method worked pretty well, the ice cream base was perfect! Full of delicious bitterness! Devine suggested to make a concentrate with the hops first, and then mix it into the base next time. Another experiment! We tried another batch of hop tea a few days after, adding twice as many hops and it ended up tasting too strong. We'll stick to warm infusions for now. 
    & The hops used in this recipe are an American variety called "Colombus". We got them from <a href=\"http://www.choppeabarrock.com\">La choppe a Barrock</a> on Villeneuve et Coloniale every time we make homebrews we pick up the ingredients there! You can buy a wide variety of hop buds there, you can even get the pellet kind.
    % recipes/hop.ice.cream.3.jpg
    & It was my second time using the ice cream maker, I got it from the 'Free stuff Montreal' group on facebook. It looks like a little red pail, super cute. The woman I got it from even had the manual! You can make ice cream without a machine, although having one helps with the 'churning' process. It saves a lot of time and effort. If i hadn't gotten that ice cream maker for free, i dont think id have one but since it's here might as well use it!
    & This recipe wouldn't have happened without the instructions from <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-vegan-ice-cream-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-204755\">The Kitchn</a>. Their vegan ice cream tutorial was super helpful. They have a ton of images on their site too, so if you're more of a 'visual' cook you should check it out!
    & If you too, are having too many beers these days, try and cook with hops instead. Same taste, different format!
  INST
    Preparation
      - Roughly chop 7 hop buds (may want to use less if you want it less hoppy). Place leaves into the center of a cheese cloth and make a little loose pouch with it, tying the end. Reserve for later.
      - Shake your 2 cans of coconut milk before opening them, full-fat coconut milk separates over time and shaking will help to mix it up again. Reserve 1/2 a cup of coconut milk for later, put the rest in a pan with 1/2 cup of maple syrup and 1/4 tsp of sea salt. Bring up to medium-low heat, stir until the maple syrup has dissolved completely.
      - Stir 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch into the 1/2 cup of coconut milk that was set aside, when dissolved pour into the pan with the rest of the coconut milk while whisking slowly. Increase the heat to medium and add your hop pouch! Let the mixture cook for about 8 minutes, don't let it come to a boil. Reduce the heat if necessary. Move the pouch around once in a while, pinching it down lightly with a wooden spoon to get some of that nice hop flavour out into your ice cream base.
      - Remove from heat, stir in 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Leave it to cool, don't remove the hop pouch!
      - When cool, take the pouch out and squeeze out all of the 'hop juice' into the pan using your hands. Mix one last time and pour into a container. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the top so you don't get a 'skin' forming on the surface. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight!).
      - Pull your ice cream out of the fridge, it should have a thick pudding-like texture. Pour into your ice cream maker and churn it to desired consistency (i let it run for ~23 minutes). If you don't have an ice cream maker, please refer to any these 6 methods from the Kitchn - <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-ice-cream-without-an-ice-cream-machine-171060\">'6 ways to make ice cream without an ice cream machine'</a>.
      - Transfer to a container and press a sheet of parchment paper over the top to keep ice crystals from forming. Your ice cream should be ready to eat in 5 hours or so! If you want harder ice cream wait until the next day to eat it. Enjoy!

    & Using veggies as noodles in a dish, is something I really enjoy doing. It tastes fresh, and is ready in a second! Thank you julienne peeler, your precense in my kitchen has made the process of cutting vegetables in thin strips, enjoyable. Spending an evening cutting daikon or cucumbers thinly by hand, are now nothing but a distant memory. Brought home a bag full of beautiful heirloom carrots, from Jean-Talon market last weekend. I've been using them in meals all week. Heirloom carrots come in a wide variety of colours. The yellow ones, I thought, resembled pasta. Thus came the idea for heirloom carrot pasta! 
    & I used yellow and red carrots for this recipe, love how these veggies are coloured all the way down to the core. Zucchinis make great pasta noodles, but the white interior makes for a dull-looking meal. It looks especially beautiful with a sunflower "cheese" sauce. As you know, I'm allergic to tree nuts so my vegan cheese alternatives are somewhat limited. Luckily, I can have seeds which can be used interchangeably with nuts in most pasta sauce recipes. It produces a similar result, just as creamy and just as nutritious!
    & Until recently, I didn't know why you had to soak seeds and nuts before eating them. As it turns out, they have their own personal defense mechanisms. Nutritional inhibitors and toxic substances. Ingesting seeds, or nuts, without soaking, makes it harder to digest. You're also missing out on a ton of nutritional benefits. The last time I made this recipe, I tried the quick boiling method. It is easier to grind down into a sauce, but it will still be hard on your digestive system. My stomach groaned for hours after that meal, I personally prefer to soak the seeds overnight.
    & The idea for a sunflower seed sauce came from <a href=\"http://www.vegansandra.com/2014/10/sunflower-seeds-are-new-cashews.html\">Vegan Sandra</a> in her post she talks about how sunflower seeds are the new cashews. She provides a recipe that I used as a base for my carrot pasta. Enjoy!
  INST
    Preparation
      - Dissolve 1/2 tsp of sea salt in 1/2 cup of water. Add sunflower seeds, cover with a breathable material and leave to soak overnight or for at least 8 hours. <small>Alternatively, you can pour boiling water over the seeds and let them soak for 10 minutes. This method is quicker but it will be less nutritious</small>
      - Sautee 1 chopped yellow onion and 2 garlic cloves in a pan with a tsp of olive oil. Cook until onion is translucent.
      - Rinse the sunflower seeds, and puree in a blender with the cooked garlic and onion, 1 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari), 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika, 1 heaping tsp of white miso, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast and 1/2 cup of water. Blend until smooth.
      - Peel and cut 4 large heirloom carrots into thin strips, using a julienne peeler or spiralizer will make your life a lot easier. The goal is to make pasta-like strips.
      - Add a bit of water to a pot, bring to a boil. Place steamer basket in the pot, cover and steam the carrots for a minute. <small>You don't have to steam your carrots, but personally I like to do it so they're not as stiff. Depending on the thickness of your carrots you may need more or less.</small>

    & Even if I don't live in Tokyo anymore, I try and keep up with what's happening over there. I still follow the news, and try to translate some simple texts to see how many kanji i've forgotten. My favourite kanji, is the one for bone '骨' (pronounced 'ho-ne'). I also love the kanji combination for jellyfish or '水母' (pronounced 'ku-ra-ge'), which beautifully translates to 'water mother'. These two words come together to create this expression '水母の' or 'jellyfish bones'. It is used when talking about something that you would not expect to exist, like bones in a jellyfish. I could go on, but seeing as how this has nothing to with food, here goes. The recipe i'm sharing with you today is japanese inspired, and is also currently part of a craze over there. I made some onigirazu, a sort of hybrid, japanese rice ball sandwich.
    % recipes/carrot.kinpira.onigirazu.1.jpg
    & The word onigiri (or nigiru) means to press into shape using your hands, while "razu" means the opposite. Free form onigiri! This is perfect for people who have a hard time making rice balls, as is the case for me. Onigirazu has the same great taste, without the fear of imperfection. All the shame is hidden away under a blanket of nori, and fillings.
    & The concept of this rice sandwich, is perfect when you don't have the right type of rice available for onigiri. You can use just about any type, i tested it out with some Minute Rice and it worked perfectly. I was given some coupons to try out their products, i'm all for experimentation so i picked up a box of whole grain brown Minute Rice. It was my fist time trying it, I generally purchase rice in bulk. Bulk is cheaper, and has a lot less packaging. After cooking with it though, i do see the appeal. The rice is 'parboiled', which means that you wont have to wait very long for your meal to be ready. Your rice will be cooked in 1/4 of the time it takes for traditional brown rice. As you all know sticky rice takes a long time to cook, I don't mind having to wait after my rice, but I know that not everyone has that luxury. It's a good thing that this option exists, it means it's even easier to cook great meals, rapidly at home.
    % recipes/carrot.kinpira.onigirazu.2.jpg
    & The rice was seasoned with miso for added flavour, and was filled with carrot kinpira. Kinpira means "sauteed" (sually with a mixture of mirin soy sauce and chili peppers.) It's a sweet, and spicy dish that is often served in bentos. I knew I wanted this as a filling for my onigirazu, to satisfy my sudden craving for japanese food. This would have been amazing with gobo, but finding the root here in Montreal is no easy task.

    Kinpira carrot
      - Peel and cut 1 large carrot into thin strips.
      - Stir these ingredients together to make the sauce for the kinpira - 1 teaspoon of maple syrup, 1 teaspoon of mirin and 2 teaspons of soy sauce.
      - Heat 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a pan at medium heat, add the carrot strips and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of chili pepper flakes as well as the sauce prepared in the previous step. Cook until no liquid remains. Let cool.
    Rice
      - Dissolve 1 tbsp of white miso in 1 cup of water and pour into pot with 1 cup of parboiled whole grain brown rice (I used Minute rice). Bring to a boil; once it starts to bubble up lower to a simmer, cover and cook for 5-10 minutes or until all of the liquid has been absorbed. 
    Combine
      - Lay out 2 pieces of nori sheets, rough side up. Divide half of the rice in the middle of the 2 sheets, then divide the carrot kinpira into 2 portions and lay over the rice. Cover the carrots with the remaining rice.
      - Now take one corner of the nori sheet and fold over into the middle, do the same for the opposing corner. Then repeat for the other 2 corners; press down gently. Wait until the nori has softened and then cut into the middle!

    & When it comes to plant-based cold desserts, Montreal has a lot of options. The places I tried are all within walking distance, because generally when I want ice cream i don't want to have to go far to get it. Luckily, the 2 places that are near my home offer dairy-free options, though often this means sorbet. While I like sorbet, the flavors are rarely as creative as milk-based ice creams. When I don't want sorbet, I just make my own ice cream at home. I have many other ice cream recipes on this blog, but some of them require a bit more waiting time and effort, which admittedly I don't always care for. Banana ice cream to the rescue! A delicious and simple alternative to dairy or coconut based desserts.

    & I was introduced to vanilla ice cream with a balsamic vinegar coulis, at my friend Lisa's small, Shimokitazawa appartment. It was summer, we wanted to cool our insides. Tokyo summers are unbearably warm. I can't say I remember where I got the idea to put balsamic vinegar on ice cream, it might have been in a magazine or a restaurant. That evening, it came to mind, and we tested it out. It was fantastic! Not things i thought could go well together. 
    % recipes/balsamic.banana.ice.cream.2.jpg
    & I remembered that night today, and desperarely wanted to re-create a dairy-free version of it. Lots of blogs I love have also been making banana-based recipes, I first saw a recipe on the whole foods website for it. Making it is incredibly easy, you just put bananas in the freezer. While you wait for them to harden up, you can prepare your balsamic coulis and make your appartment reek of vinegar - yay! If you've ever boiled balsamic vinegar, you know what I'm talking about. I didn't want to pour the vinegar straight from the bottle over the ice cream, making a reduction makes it thick and syrupy, and it just works better as a topping.
    & I don't have a powerful blender or food processor at home, so reducing the 2 frozen banana chunks to a smooth puree was difficult. It took longer than i thought it would, and because of that my ice cream was melting when the time came to take photos. So pro-tip, don't use an immersion blender. If you're desperate and/or reckless and want to try it anyways, do it in batches.

    Balsamic reduction
      - Put 1 cup of balsamic vinegar in a non-stick pan. Bring up to medium high heat, once it starts to boil bring down to medium low and let simmer until the vinegar has been reduced by a little more than half. Stir it on occasion <small>Make sure you have an open window or the overhead fan running because boiling vinegar has a really strong smell</small>
      - Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, then store in the refrigerator. It will thicken when it gets cold. <small>This recipe makes a lot of balsamic reduction, it's hard to make very little. It keeps in the refrigerator for a while so you can easily use it in other recipes. It's great when served over fruit</small>
    Banana
      - Peel and cut 2 bananas into slices, lay slices flat onto a plate and put in the freezer for at least 2h. Put banana slices in a blender or food processor with 1/4 cup of soy milk and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, process until smooth. 
      - Serve in individual bowls with a tsp or more of balsamic reduction.

    & This time last year, Grim Grains was born. If you were there at the start of it all, you'll remember that the first recipe I posted was black scones (my lovely eatable meteorites). Cooking had become a passion, this blog needed to happen. I was freelancing back then, and had a lot of time to dedicate to the project. Nowadays, I work in studio all day and finding time to cook up new foods is tough. Because of this, my meals have become simpler. I feel my meals will continue to be simple, due to the fact that me and Devine will be embarking on an exciting new adventure next year: we want to live on a sailboat. If you've ever been on one, you know that space is an issue. I'm not only talking about storage, but also about refrigeration. Grim Grains will still happen, but will be very different. Hopefully, I'll still be able to make my own pâté.
    & I wanted to try and re-create a curry pâté I had some time ago. While I didn't have sunflower seeds to use as a base, I had a jar full of pumpkin seeds! As you know, pumpkin seeds can be expensive, I recommend buying it in bulk (I ordered mine from Yupik.com). As with my veggie pate recipe, the seeds need to be soaked prior to blending. To learn more about the why's and how's of seed soaking check out the article {{Soaking nuts and seeds|http://healthyblenderrecipes.com/info/soaking_grains_nuts_seeds}} by the Blender Girl.
    & This pâté can be used on toast, sliced cucumbers or other veggies. Sometimes I cube it up and use it as a topping for salads and other meals.

    & The vegemite caramel mix of the Cadbury bar intrigued me. Vegemite is very salty, but I happen to be a big fan of salted sweets – I'm looking at you sea salt chocolate. If I added some to date caramel (instead of salt) I knew it would taste good. I have Alissa from <a href=\"http://www.nourishingmeals.com/2010/09/raw-caramel-dip-for-apples.html\">Nourishing meals</a> to thank for the idea of date caramel. I used deglet noor dates for this recipe (because it's what I had). Feel free to use medjool dates instead. Medjool dates are great, but you don't have to use them. They're expensive, and their cheaper counterpart works just fine.
    & I was right, it tastes amazing. Cut a few apples up, and dip them right into the vegemite caramel! You can also spread it over some toast! This is a weird mix, but believe me, it tastes awesome.

    & These are perfect if you don't like sweet deserts, coconut sugar has a subtle and more complex taste. Coconut sugar will make your cookies a darker shade of orange, almost brown. I think it fits nicely with the toned-down color of the pumpkin seeds. If you want a bold orange color, use white cane sugar instead.

    Cookie dough
      - Preheat oven to 350F .
      - Steam 1/2 cup's worth of pumpkin cubes. Set aside to cool. 
      - Stir 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, 1/2 cup of spelt flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder together in a bowl.
      - Put the steamed pumpkin, the 4 tbsp of melted vegan butter as well as the 1/2 cup of coconut sugar in another bowl. Mash the pumpkin with a fork (or use a hand blender) and stir everything together until smooth and well mixed.
      - Add the wet to the dry ingredients, mix with a wooden spoon until you get a soft and consistent dough. It will be sticky but that's fine, if it's too sticky feel free to add a bit of extra flour. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
      - Line a baking sheet with a silpat (or parchment paper). Make little balls of dough, as round as you can make them, and flatten each one gently. Bake for 15 minutes.
      - Decorate each cookie with 3 pumpkin seeds, sticking them at the top (pointy end in).
    Chocolate
      - Mix 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp maple syrup and a pinch of salt together in a glass bowl. 
      - Put a bit of water to boil in a pot (large enough to fit your bowl, or to have it hanging overtop).
      - Lower the heat to a simmer, add the glass bowl with the chocolate into the pot, stir with a spoon until the chocolate is smooth and runny. 
      - Remove from heat.
      - Take a toothpick and dip into the chocolate, draw pumpkin faces on your cookies and serve as is!\
    Extra chocolate treat
      - As for the rest of your chocolate mixture, pour it in a chocolate mold or shallow container and put it in the freezer. It will become solid and you'll have delicious homemade chocolate on the side for later times! Once it's solid, pop it out of the mold and put it in a closed container.

    & The kind people at <a href=\"http://www.daybreakmill.com\">Daybreak Mill</a> sent me a bag of einkorn flour last week, I'd never heard of it before. Einkorn was one of the first domesticated and cultivated plants. It has a higher percentage of protein than regular wheat, with high levels of fat, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine (a form of vitamin b6) and beta-carotene. Another great thing about it, is that it isn't as toxic to people on gluten-free diets. This wasn't proven, but it's worth looking into!

    & I tried baking bread with it this week, it did not rise all that well. While it is a dense loaf, the texture is quite nice! It has a strong nutty taste, making it more flavorful than regular wheat. Einkorn bread is filling, I don't think I would use it to make a sandwich but it makes nice breakfast toast.
    & After my bread experiment, I decided to try and make something sweet. The dates, coconut sugar and carob chips create a strong caramel taste. The fleur de sel sprinkled overtop brings out the flavor nicely.
    & I can't thank Daybreak mill enough for sending me this gift, and for introducing me to einkorn flour! Their products are grown with the utmost care. You can get your own einkorn flour from their website, they also have a ton of other great products. Encouraging companies that share your outlook on food and life is important.

    Preparation

      - Pre-heat oven to 350F.
      - Make your flax egg - put 1 tbsp of ground-up flax seeds with 3 tbsp of water, let thicken for 5 minutes.
      - In a large bowl, mix 1 cup + 3 tbsp of einkorn flour with 3/4 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp of salt.

      - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or with a silpat if you have one) and scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of cookie dough. Roll them out with your hands and place them on the baking sheet, making sure there's enough space between each one. Sprinkle some fleur de sel on top and bake for 10 minutes, repeat until you run out of cookie dough. Let cool on baking sheet before transfering to a cooling rack. Makes about 20 cookies.

      - Soak dry chickpeas overnight (or for 8h). Drain, rinse and cook according to pressure cooker instructions. I cook mine at the longer time, so they soften up. <small>Alternatively, you can use a can of chickpeas </small>
      - Pressure cooker chickpeas come out a lot softer, if cooked at the longer time. Because of this, they don't need to be mashed as much. If you decide to use canned chickpeas (1 can will do), you may have to put a bit more effort to soften them up.
      - Mix the mashed chickpeas with 3-4 tbsp (or more, to taste) of tofu mayo, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp kelp powder, 2 branches of chopped scallions and 1/4 tsp of cayenne powder.

    & The idea of making beer bread came from a book written by Lin Pardey called "The Care and Feeding of the Offshore Crew". In this book, Lin talks about cooking at sea and has an entire chapter dedicated to baking onboard. In this chapter, the authot talks about the many ways to make fresh bread while sailing, including a quickbread recipe that uses 3 basic ingredients: flour, sugar and beer. 
    & Beer bread you say? Right up my alley! The next day I gave it a try, the result is fantastic - surprising given the little effort it takes to make it.
    & The best thing about this bread, is that it can taste different everytime. Using different beer, will change the taste and color of the bread. I tried baking with an IPA (21st amendment), a Hefeweizen (Sunriver brewing co) and a brown ale (Hobgoblin).
    & If you have self-rising flour, you can omit the baking powder and salt. You can use even less ingredients if you have a craft beer that has live yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. If you have a beer like that only flour, sugar and beer will do. Have fun experimenting with beers in your bread!

I make my own shampoo, deodorant, toilet cleaner, kitchen cleaner and I also make my own toothpaste.

The recipe consists of baking soda, foodgrade bamboo charcoal powder, coconut oil and peppermint oil (also food grade). You can omit the bamboo charcoal to make your own toothpaste, it will work just as well. If you want black toothpaste to match your black-everything though, this is a must. If you want some, make sure to get it from a reliable source. If you're a hardcore minimalist, you can also brush your teeth with a simple baking soda and water paste (though the saltiness can be overwhelming). Adding coconut and peppermint oil, makes for a better taste and texture. In colder climates, your toothpaste will solidify. Scraping some onto your toothbrush can be a challenge. Put the jar near a heater for 5 minutes or so to help soften it down.

    & Before we arrived in the Marquesas, people made a point of telling us how difficult it was to find vegetables there. We heard that if we wanted tomatoes, we would need to get up at 4am to get them at the market. Devine & I are early risers, but we lack the will to take the dinghy to shore in the dark. It's just as well, because others we met who had tried, came back empty-handed. In the Marquesas, most vegetables are brought in by supply ships; you can never be certain of what you're going to get. Potatoes, cucumbers, cabbages and eggplants we had plenty of, but vegetables like tomatoes, pumpkins, bok choy and salad greens were like rare pokemon. 
    & We'd only ever made bruschetta topping with tomatoes, never thought of changing it for anything else. But then I thought, what looks like tomatoes? Papaya! They have a similar reddish tint, comparable texture too. Papaya is something Nuku Hiva has plenty of, and as it turns out, we prefer it over tomatoes now. Papaya is more firm and sweet, and pairs well with balsamic vinegar. I imagine it would taste great with mangoes too, it's something I may try when I get a craving again.

    & Breadfruit trees are everywhere in French Polynesia, but sometimes the fruit aren’t mature enough to pick. To make things more difficult, grocery stores don’t sell them (they don’t sell fruit either). The Polynesians don't buy fruit, they don't have to! They have plenty growing on their property. If they don’t have something, they can trade with neighbours for theirs. Getting our hands on a breadfruit was no simple task, but we are patient. At every island, we would ask the locals, but again, the fruit weren’t ready to pick off yet. 
    & Devine & I had breadfruit when we first arrived in Nuku Hiva, the owner of snack Vaeki prepared some for us. The chef cooked it outside, over hot coals. The taste is hard to describe, it's very potato-ey. We had the cooked breadfruit with some fresh coconut milk - extracted from a fresh coconut before our very eyes. Since then, we’ve been looking to cook it ourselves.

    & While Devine & I were still in British Columbia, I remember one morning waking up to the sound knocking at our boat. It was our neighbours, coming to offer some homemade pan-fried corn pone. I'd never had corn pone before, nor did i ever think of making any sort of flat cake using corn as a base. After that, I started to make it myself and would serve it with chili - lazy cornbread, as I like to call it. While sitting in the Niue yatch club, i found an old vegetarian cookbook; I must have spent an hour reading through it, the recipes were fantastic. The title read "The Farm vegetarian cookbook". It was sitting there, amongst a panoply of writting, including a Polish Murakami book (how I wish it had been written in english). The cookbook had an entire section dedicated to cooking with corn. It's in here, that I found a recipe for masa dumplings. 
    & Masa is corn that is simmered and ground into a paste. It's the base for many recipes, you can make Mexican-style tortillas with it! Or, you can use it to make dumplings! I don't have access to fresh corn, nor do i have the space or the time to make my own masa, but I used polenta (corn semolina) instead and it worked! The only difference is that you need to add boiling water so you you can roll the mixture into balls. If you were to use masa, you wouldn't need the added moisture. The texture of the dumplings is fun and chewy. The outside is soft, but the inside is like that of dense cornbread. Corn dumplings, I imagine, could be used to make fake meatballs. Devine & I enjoy eating it with tomato sauce or with a spicy apricot sauce.
    & Instead of apricot jam, you can add apricot juice to the mix (orange will taste wonderful too). I added jam because I don't have any juice on the boat currently, and besides, it works well in this recipe. Enjoy!

    Preparation
      - Mix 1 cup corn semolina, 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt. Stir until well mixed.
      - Bring 1 cup of water to a boil, pour into dry ingredients and mix well. When the dough is wet and sticky, form 1/2" balls with your hands. You can make larger or smaller balls, note that cooking time will change if the diameter is bigger (15 minutes will do it.)
      - Bring a big pot of water to a boil, add corn balls and boil for 10-15 minutes (i don't have a big pot, so i did it in batches.)
      - Drain, let cool.
    Sauce
      - Mix all sauce ingredients together (all, except the cornstarch). 
      - Put 1 tsp of cornstarch in a bowl, and dissolve in 1/4 cup of water. Set aside.

    & Breadfruit has a taste and texture that resembles that of {{potato}}. And so, it only makes sense that it too, can be made into gnocchi. The flesh of the fruit can be kneaded easily, especially if the fruit is very ripe. I have tried to knead it when half-ripe, it works too, but requires added moisture and more kneading - not to mention that it doesn't have as much flavor. Ripe breadfruit develops a sweet taste, it can be difficult to catch it at the right moment, like avocados, sometimes it'll overripen overnight and be rendered uneatable. Because we like it so much, we've bought many and have had time to better tell when it can be eaten. The outside becomes very soft to the touch, but only just. 
    & We serve these with a light sauce, to better taste the gnocchi. A sauce that we enjoy, is minced garlic and chili peppers cooked in olive oil. The sauce is poured overtop and sprinkled with bits of shredded nori.

The recipe is for a cheese that can be cut into wedges, or that can be grated over pizza.

      - For the filling, mix all of the dry ingredients into a bowl, then add all the wet ones (including the spinach) and stir well until evenly mixed. 
      - Heat a pan at medium heat, pour the filling into it. The mixture will thicken, when it does, transfer it back to a bowl and keep it aside for later. 
      - To make the dough, mix {#1/2 tsp#} of {{salt}} with {#1 cup#} of {{all purpose flour}}. Add {#2/3 cup#} of water, knead the dough on a floured surface, working in some extra flour if the dough is too sticky. Once you have a smooth ball of dough, wrap it up and let it rest for at least {#10 minutes#}. 
      - Divide the dough into two pieces, and roll out the first half of the dough to make it as thin as possible (and as rectangular as possible). Roll out the second piece of dough into a similar size and thickess. 
      - On the first sheet of pasta, place a mound of filling of the faux-cheese and spinach mixture every 2 inches across and down the pasta (spaced out to look like a checker board).
      - Dip your finger into a bowl of water and make a line inbetween each row of filling (the water acts as a bond to hold the ravioli together). 
      - Place the second sheet of rolled-out pasta on top of the first one, pressing down firmly around the filling and along the wetted lines.
      - With a knife (or ravioli cutter, if you feel fancy), cut the pasta into squares along the wetted lines. Keep separated pieces of ravioli aside.
      - Bring a pot of water to a boil, and add the ravioli. Stir them gently to keep them from sticking to another another or on the bottom of the pot. Cook for {#7-8 minutes#} or until tender.

Each fruit has about 40-80 keys, the part of the keys that is attached to the core is soft, and a bright orange colour. In the Marshall Islands, people suck on the orange part which is sweet and tastes of cane sugar. The soft part can also be cut, and processed into juice.

    & We always try our hardest to buy as little packaged foods as we can, and if we do buy pre-made goods, we aim for glass. This, too, isn't always possible. 
    & We ran out of mustard the other day, and couldn't find any at the store that wasn't packaged in plastic. We decided then, that it was better to make our own. It requires few ingredients, little time to prepare (25min for prep, few days for soaking), and is inexpensive. 
    & How do you do you start? First, you have to find raw mustard seeds. You can choose between yellow, brown and black seeds; these, affect the 'heat' of the mustard. A dark seed imparts more flavour than the lighter variety, and is what we used in this recipe. The seeds are then soaked in a mixture of water and ACV (apple cider vinegar), although you can also use beer and white wine as a base. This recipe uses ACV. The water should be room temperature, or cold, using hot liquids denatures the enzymes that create the 'heat' in mustard.  
    & We don't have {{tools|#tools}} onboard that requires electricity, to grind and crush seeds and herbs we use a {*heavy ceramic mortar and pestle*}. 
    & After the mustard has been ground, it can stored in a glass jar at room temperature. Because of its antibacterial properties, mustard {*does not require refrigeration*} - another plus!

    & The best thing about making it yourself, is that you can vary the quantities and base ingredients according to your personal preferences. If you don't like having a strong vinegar taste, you can lessen the amount of ACV and add more water instead. You can also add spices and sweeteners. For traditional 'yellow mustard', all you need to do is add turmeric (for color) and a sweetener - the possibilities are endless. Give it a shot, it's cheap, fun and there's no plastic involved!

    Mustard
      - Soak 1/4 cup of {{mustard seeds}} in a mixture of {#45ml#} of {{apple cider vinegar}} and {#20ml#} of water.
      - Let soak for a few days, or until seeds have expanded 3 times their size (from 3 to 7 days). If the seeds have soaked up all of the liquids, add more water. 
      - Drain the seeds from the liquids. Reserve liquids for later.
      - If you've got a blender or food processor, puree the seeds until smooth. Otherwise, add a small quantity of seeds in your mortar and grind them down with your pestle. Repeat till all the seeds are crushed and pureed - doesn't need to be perfectly smooth.
      - Add the reserved liquid from before, bit by bit, until you get a smooth consistency.
      - Store into a glass jar at room temperature, and enjoy!

CRACKERS

    & Making crackers is simple, everyone should know how to make them. It's in everyone's best interest to know how things are made, there are no downsides to knowing, and in a bind it's a useful skill, but not just this - making your own produces less waste (packaging) and you control what you ingest (less salt, sugar etc). What's great about a basic recipe, is that you can swap ingredients with little consequence (most times) and you can add to it to suit your needs and cravings. 
    & Devine & I love to eat crackers as snacks, usually between breakfast and lunch, a cracker with some peanut butter to quiet our stomachs. We also like to eat {{papaya salsa|https://grimgrains.com/#papaya+bruschetta+topping}} with crackers, it makes a good scooping vessel for the fruit.
    & You can make these crackers without extras with just the 'cracker' portion of the recipe, they're just as delicious that way, but you can add seeds and spices for added flavour and nutrition. I like to add seeds to mine, like pumpkin seeds, flax seeds,  sesame seeds or sunflower seeds. I recommend adding black pepper, or chilis, these are also delicious if you sprinkle some salt overtop of them.

    & In this recipe, I recommend using a mortar and pestle to grind the oats, but a food processor will also work. You can use another sweetener, I used whole cane sugar because it's what's available to me at the moment, but otherwise i'd opt for maple syrup. I prefer to use a baking mat (I have a copper baking mat) than parchment paper, since it's reusable and easy to clean.
