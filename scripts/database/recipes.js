    & Start your morning off right, with the nutty and earthy flavour of houjicha oatmeal. If you're not familiar with houjicha, visit a tea shop and ask for it. It's a japanese roasted tea that is often served with sweet and savoury dishes. It's a good low-caffeine alternative to most teas, and adds just the right amount of flavour to oatmeal without overpowering it. Try it! 
    & Happy cooking!
