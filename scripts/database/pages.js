ABOUT
  BREF : I started {*Grim Grains*} once I realized that food could be artistically fulfilling. Cooking became an creative output, while the blog allowed me to document my progress and keep track of the things I made. The blog is about being artistically creative with food and colour. Colours for added nutrition, for contrast and for visual harmony. Most of my recipes are also nut-free and plant-based.

TOOLS
  BREF : Entering a store, with the goal of purchasing kitchenware can be a dizzying experience. I made this list of notes on what to look for in a specialty tool, based on experience and research: 
  LONG
    & {*Durability*}: Choose a material that will last, or that can be composted.
    & {*Simplicity*}: Prioritize unibody tools, they don't break as easily. The fewer parts the better, opting for non-electric is important for that same reason.
    & {*Multi-functional*}: Having too many tools that have a single function, adds clutter to our home and in our minds. Its best to do away with it.
    * Cutting boards
    & Opt for a maple or bamboo hardwood cutting board. Avoid plastic. Contrary to popular belief, it is not more sanitary and can harbour a lot of bacteria. A knife-scarred plastic surface is difficult to disinfect, and studies have shown that washing the board – whether by hand or with a dishwasher – was not enough to kill lingering bacteria. 
    & Wood doesn't scar as easily, and is the preferred material. After cleaning, it must be allowed to dry thoroughly.

    * Manual coffee grinder
    & If you enjoy {{coffee|#coffee}}, getting a grinder should be on the top of your list. Grinding your own beans, means you can choose the size of the grind to match the selected brewing method. 
    & Choose a manual grinder with ceramic burrs, the two plates crush the beans into even grinds, and is the best way to release the oils that are responsible for the flavour of the coffee. Steel burrs, while cheaper, don't last as long as the ceramic kind. Aim for long-lasting, rather than cheap. As for blade grinders, they grind unevenly and will not do.

    * Mortar and pestle
    & Unlike other types of tools, your intended use will determine the choice of material of your future mortar and pestle. Will you grind spices with it? Nuts? Fibrous herbs? The best material, for the most varied jobs, is granite. Its weight and irregular surface makes it easy to grind most spices, nuts, and can handle fibrous herbs well enough. 
    & If you have no intention of grinding nuts and herbs, a marble mortar with a smooth surface will do fine. Wood mortars are discouraged, that is, unless you want to re-use it for the same purpose over and over again. Flavor lingers into the bowl, and may result in unwanted tastes in other recipes. There are other materials to consider, but all in all, a heavy, textured, granite bowl is your best bet as a good all-around mortar. 
    * Cleaver
    & The cleaver, or the chinese chef's knife, is a less brutish version of the meat cleaver. This tool has a wide variety of purposes, with it, you can dice, slice and julienne vegetables. After the item has been cut into bits, you can use the wide blade to scoop everything up. There is no real need for other knives in your artillery. 
    & When selecting your cleaver, aim for a harder grade of steel – somewhere between 57-58 on the {{Rockwell Hardness Scale|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_scale}}. Good steel produces a finer edge, and holds its sharpness. The angle of the blade is also important, 22 degrees is most common and this too, ensures longer-lasting sharpness.
    & The handle of the cleaver should not be too thick or too small, the size has to allow the hand to wrap around it and to just touch the other side of your thumb. Traditionally, Chinese cleavers are made of carbon steel, but because these are prone to rust stainless steel is preferred (a mixture of carbon and SS is also good).
    * Shears (Nigiri)
    & Traditional Japanese shears, or Nigiri, are forged using a single piece of metal and spring back to the open position when released. While the design is simple and durable, it offers more precision than scissors. Nigiri can be used to cut some herbs from the garden to add to a meal, or cutting dried mushrooms or chilies into smaller bits, there are over 100 uses for it. 
    & Most shears are made from carbon steel, stainless steel is again, preferable. A pair with blades that make more than half of the length of the tool, will permit for a greater variety of uses. The shears rest inside your hand, between your index finger and thumb, giving greater control of the speed of the cut. This tool, is also ideal for left-handed people, making cutting a pain-free experience.
