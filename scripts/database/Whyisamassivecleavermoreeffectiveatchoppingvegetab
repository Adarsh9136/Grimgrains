Cleaver

The cleaver, or the chinese chef's knife, is a less brutish version of the meat cleaver. This tool has a wide variety of purposes, with it, you can dice, slice and julienne vegetables. After the item has been cut into bits, you can use the wide blade to scoop everything up. There is no real need for other knives in your artillery. 

When selecting your cleaver, aim for a harder grade of steel â€“ somewhere between 57-58 on the {{Rockwell Hardness Scale|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_scale}}. A good steel produces a finer edge, and holds its sharpness. The angle of the blade is also important, 22 degrees is most common.

The handle of the cleaver should not be too thick or too small, the size has to allow the hand to wrap around it and to just touch the other side of your thumb. Traditionally, Chinese cleavers are made of carbon steel, but because these are prone to rust stainless steel is preferred (a mixture of carbon and SS is also good).
