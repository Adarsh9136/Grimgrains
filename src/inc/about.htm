<h1>About</h1>

<p>We started <b>Grimgrains</b> to teach ourselves how to cook. This blog, which now doubles as a travel diary, helps track our habits as we adapt to the localy available produce. All of these recipes are plant-based, and tree-nut free.</p>

<p>This website showcases our favourite creations, along with hand-drawn illustrations for each ingredient. The pages were generated entirely in the classic C99 programming language, and the sources can be found on <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Grimgrains' class='external' target='_blank'>Github</a>.</p>
