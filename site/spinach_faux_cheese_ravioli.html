<h1>spinach faux cheese ravioli</h1>
<h2>cheese filling</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the filling, mix all of the dry ingredients into a bowl, then add all the wet ones (including the chopped <a href='spinach.html'>spinach</a>) and stir well until evenly mixed.</li>
<li>Heat a pan at medium heat, pour the filling into it. The mixture will thicken. When it does, transfer it back to a bowl and keep it aside for later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ravioli</h2>
<ul>
<li>To make the dough, mix <i>1/2 tsp</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a> with <i>1 cup</i> of <a href='all_purpose_flour.html'>all purpose flour</a>. Add <i>2/3 cup</i> of water, knead the dough on a floured surface, working in extra flour if the dough is too sticky. Once you have a smooth ball of dough, wrap it up and let it rest for at least <u>10 minutes</u>.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into two pieces, and roll out the first half of the dough to make it as thin as possible â€” and as rectangular as possible. Roll out the second piece of dough into a similar size and thickess.</li>
<li>On the first sheet of pasta, place a mound of filling of the faux-cheese and spinach mixture every 2 inches across and down the pasta (spaced out to look like a checker board).</li>
<li>Dip your finger into a bowl of water, and make a line inbetween each row of filling (the water acts as a bond to hold the ravioli together).</li>
<li>Place the second sheet of rolled-out pasta on top of the first one, pressing down firmly around the filling and along the wetted lines.</li>
<li>With a knife (or ravioli cutter, if you feel fancy), cut the pasta into squares along the wetted lines. Keep separated pieces of ravioli aside.</li>
<li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, and add the ravioli. Stir them gently to keep them from sticking to another another or on the bottom of the pot. Cook for <u>7-8 minutes</u> or until fork tender.</li>
<li>Serve with a light sauce, we made one with <a href='chilis_pepper_flakes.html'>chilis pepper flakes</a>, fresh <a href='basil.html'>basil</a> and <a href='olive_oil.html'>olive oil</a>. A light tomato sauce would also be delicious.</li>
</ul>
