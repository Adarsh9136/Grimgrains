<h1>breadfruit gnocchi</h1>
<h2>gnocchi</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wait until your <a href='breadfruit.html'>breadfruit</a> is very ripe, soft to the touch. A softer breadfruit will be easier to knead, and will taste sweeter.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to <u>425F</u>. Rub outside of breadfruit with <a href='olive_oil.html'>olive oil</a>, and wrap with aluminium foil. Cook for <u>1 hour</u>.</li>
<li>Remove foil, peel skin away, cut in half, and remove the seed.</li>
<li>Let cool, and mash with your hands into a cohesive dough. Add <a href='flour.html'>flour</a>, <i>1/4 cup</i> at a time, until the <a href='breadfruit.html'>breadfruit</a> flesh stops sticking to your fingers. You may need more, or less, depending on the size of your fruit.</li>
<li>Sprinkle your work surface with <a href='flour.html'>flour</a>, take a golf-sized ball of dough, and roll it into a thin, finger-sized log. Cut the log into bite-sized pieces (around 2cm long) and repeat for the rest of the dough.</li>
<li>At this point, you can choose to freeze the gnocchi, or to prepare them straight away. To cook them, bring a pot of <a href='water.html'>water</a> to a boil, add the gnocchi, and cook for <u>5 minutes</u> or so, or <i>until they start to rise to the surface</i>.</li>
<li>Serve with a light sauce, to better taste the subtle, but sweet flavor of the breadfruit gnocchi.</li>
</ul>
