<h1>basic black bread</h1>
<h2>bread</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a large bowl, stir <i>1 1/2 tsp</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a> and <i>3/4 tbsp</i> of <a href='maple_syrup.html'>maple syrup</a> in <i>1 cup</i> of <a href='warm_water.html'>warm water</a> until dissolved. Sprinkle tsp of <a href='active_dry_yeast.html'>active dry yeast</a>, let sit for <u>10 minutes</u>.</li>
<li>Sift <i>1 1/2 cups</i> of <a href='all_purpose_flour.html'>all purpose flour</a>, <i>1 1/2 cups</i> of <a href='whole_grain_flour.html'>whole grain flour</a> and <i>1 tsp</i> of <a href='bamboo_charcoal_powder.html'>bamboo charcoal powder</a> together in a separate bowl. Once flours are mixed evenly enough.</li>
<li>Add <i>1 tbsp</i> of <a href='canola_oil.html'>canola oil</a> to the water mix, then stir in <i>1/2 cup</i> of the flour mix with a wooden spoon. Keep adding flour a <u>1/2 cup</u> at a time, until the dough stops sticking to the sides.</li>
<li>Put ball of dough on lightly floured counter-top and start kneading, add a bit of flour everytime it starts to stick to your hands. Knead for <u>15 minutes</u>. You may not use up all of your flour, if there's still a lot left and your dough is nice smooth don't add any more. Don't want to risk drying it out.</li>
<li>Heat up oven at the very lowest setting. This will be our warm place for bread rising.</li>
<li>Grease up a bowl and put the dough, rolling it once to cover all sides. Cover with a cloth and place in oven. <i>Let rise for 45 minutes</i>.</li>
<li>Your bread should have doubled in size. Take bread out of oven, knead a few times and shape into a 10-11 inch cigar-shape. Sprinkle some <a href='corn_semolina.html'>corn semolina</a> on a baking sheet and place bread on top - this will keep it from sticking. Slash the top of the bread in the middle with a knife, doing this will keep the ends of the bread from splitting. Mist top of bread lightly with <a href='water.html'>water</a>, then add <a href='white_sesame_seeds.html'>white sesame seeds</a>. Press lightly to make them stick. Cover loaf with a cloth, put back in oven to rise for an additional <u>45 minutes</u>. If you don't want a traditional bread shape, put bread in a greased loaf pan to rise.</li>
<li>Turn oven up to <u>350F</u> . Bake for <a href='30_minutes.html'>30 minutes</a>, or until it sounds hollow when tapped at the bottom.</li>
<li>Brush sides lightly with <a href='coconut_oil.html'>coconut oil</a>, then let cool on a pile of towels or a cooling rack if you have one.</li>
<li>BURGER BUNS: Repeat steps 1 to 6.</li>
<li>Instead of forming into a 'cigar' shape at step 7, <i>divide into 8 pieces</i> and shape into a tight ball. Sprinkle baking sheet with some <a href='corn_semolina.html'>corn semolina</a> and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another 45 minutes in the warmed oven.</li>
<li>Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with <a href='vegan_butter.html'>vegan butter</a> and put <a href='white_sesame_seeds.html'>white sesame seeds</a> on top. Bake uncovered for <u>20 minutes</u> at <u>350F</u>.</li>
<li>Let cool on a pile of towels or cooling rack.</li>
<li>HOT DOG BUNS: Repeat steps 1 to 6. <i>Divide through into 15 pieces</i> and shape into small cylinders (or general elongated hot dog shape). Sprinkle baking sheet with some <a href='corn_semolina.html'>corn semolina</a> and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another <u>45 minutes</u> in the warmed oven.</li>
<li>Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with <a href='coconut_oil.html'>coconut oil</a>. Bake uncovered for <u>20 minutes</u> at <u>350F</u>.</li>
<li>Let cool on a pile of towels or cooling rack.</li>
