<h1>mustard from seed</h1>
<h2>mustard</h2>
<ul>
<li>Soak <i>1/4 cup</i> of <a href='mustard_seeds.html'>mustard seeds</a> in a mixture of <i>45ml</i> of <a href='apple_cider_vinegar.html'>apple cider vinegar</a> and <i>20ml</i> of water.</li>
<li>Let soak for a few days, or until seeds have expanded 3 times their size (from 3 to 7 days). If the seeds have soaked up all of the liquids, add more water.</li>
<li>Drain the seeds from the liquids. Reserve liquids for later.</li>
<li>If you've got a blender or food processor, purée the seeds until smooth. Otherwise, add a small quantity of seeds in your mortar and grind them down with your pestle. Repeat until the seeds are crushed and puréed - the mixture doesn't need to be perfectly smooth.</li>
<li>Add the reserved liquid from before, bit by bit, until you get a nice smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Store into a glass jar at room temperature, and enjoy!</li>
</ul>
