<h2>brittle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prepare baking sheet lined with a baking mat, keep a flat spatula close by.</li>
<li>Put the <i>1/4 cup</i> of <a href='brown_sugar.html'>brown sugar</a> and <i>1/4 tsp</i> of <a href='vanilla_extract.html'>vanilla extract</a> in a pot at medium heat.</li>
<li>Stir constantly, until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
<li>Add <i>1/4 cup</i> of <a href='black_sesame_seeds.html'>black sesame seeds</a>. Mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>This part is tricky, the mixture solidifies very quickly. You need to do this fast! Take the pot, and pour its contents out onto the baking sheet. With the spatula spread and flatten it out as much as you can.</li>
