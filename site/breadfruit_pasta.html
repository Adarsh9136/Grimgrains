<ul>
<li>In a large bowl, mix <i>3/4 cup</i> of <a href='all_purpose_flour.html'>all purpose flour</a> with <i>3/4 cup</i> of <a href='breadfruit_flour.html'>breadfruit flour</a>.</li>
<li>Add <i>1/2 tsp</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a>, mix well.</li>
<li>Add <i>3/4 cup</i> of <a href='water.html'>water</a>, mix until it starts to clump up, then knead with your hands until you have a smooth dough. Let rest for <u>20 mins</u> (this will make it easier to roll).</li>
<li>Separate dough in two, put one half aside. Separating the dough makes it easier to roll if you have limited counter space (like I do).</li>
<li>Sprinkle flour on your working surface, flatten the ball out from the center to the outer edge. Continue to roll, flipping the dough over once or twice and dusting it with flour to prevent it sticking. Roll to desired thickness.</li>
<li>Fold the sheet of dough into a flat roll, then cut into it cross-wise into 0.5cm strips.</li>
<li>Repeat all the steps for the other half of the dough.</li>
<li>Carefully unroll each coil with your fingers, then transfer to a floured surface.</li>
<li>Bring water to a boil. Add pasta. Cook for a minute or so, and serve with a light sauce!</li>
</ul>
