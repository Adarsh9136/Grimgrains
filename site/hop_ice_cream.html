<h2>hop ice cream</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roughly chop 7 hop buds (may want to use less if you want it less hoppy). Place leaves into the center of a cheese cloth and make a little loose pouch with it, tying the end. Reserve for later.</li>
<li>Shake <i>2 cans</i> of <a href='coconut_milk.html'>coconut milk</a> before opening them, full-fat coconut milk separates over time and shaking will help to mix it up again. Reserve a <i>1/2 cup</i> of <a href='coconut_milk.html'>coconut milk</a> for later, put the rest in a pan with <i>1/2 cup</i> of <a href='maple_syrup.html'>maple syrup</a> and <i>1/4 tsp</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a>.</li>
<li>Bring up to medium-low heat, stir until the <a href='maple_syrup.html'>maple syrup</a> has dissolved completely.</li>
<li>Stir <i>1 1/2 tbsp</i> of <a href='cornstarch.html'>cornstarch</a> into the <i>1/2 cup</i> of <a href='coconut_milk.html'>coconut milk</a> that was set aside. When dissolved, pour into the pan with the rest of the coconut milk, while whisking slowly.</li>
<li>Increase the heat to medium and add your hop pouch! Let the mixture cook for about <u>8 minutes</u>. Don't let it come to a boil! Reduce the heat if necessary. Move the pouch around once in a while, pinching it down lightly with a wooden spoon to get some of that nice hop flavour out into your ice cream base.</li>
<li>Remove from heat, stir in <i>1 tsp</i> of <a href='vanilla_extract.html'>vanilla extract</a>. Leave it to cool â€” don't remove the hop pouch!</li>
<li>When cool, take the pouch out and squeeze out all of the 'hop juice' into the pan using your hands. Mix one last time and pour into a container. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the top so you don't get a skin forming on the surface. Refrigerate for a minimum of <u>4 hours</u> (or overnight!).</li>
<li>Pull your ice cream out of the fridge. It should have a thick pudding-like texture. Pour into your ice cream maker and churn it to desired consistency (I let it run for <u>~23 minutes</u>).</li>
<li>If you don't have an ice cream maker, please refer to any these <a href='http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-ice-cream-without-an-ice-cream-machine-171060' target='_blank'>6 methods</a> from the Kitchn.</li>
<li>Transfer to a container and press a sheet of parchment paper over the top to keep ice crystals from forming. Your ice cream should be ready to eat in <u>5 hours</u> or so! If you want harder ice cream wait until the next day to eat it. Enjoy!</li>
