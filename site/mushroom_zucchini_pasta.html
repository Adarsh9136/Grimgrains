<h1>mushroom zucchini pasta</h1>
<h2>veggie noodles and toppings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rehydrate <i>2 tbsp</i> of <a href='wakame.html'>wakame</a> in water, drain and set aside.</li>
<li>Cut stems off of <i>1/4 cup</i> of dried <a href='shiitake_mushrooms.html'>shiitake mushrooms</a>, rehydrate by pouring boiling water over them. Keep them submerged for <u>30 min</u>, or up to <u>1 hour</u>. It's better to rehydrate them overnight, for <u>a minimum of 8 hours</u>. If you do this, the flavour will be stronger, but if you're in a rush, boiling water is fine. If you have fresh <a href='shiitake.html'>shiitake</a>, you can also skip this step.</li>
<li>Cut <i>4 medium-sized</i> <a href='zucchinis.html'>zucchinis</a> thinly using a julienne peeler or knife. Place in bowls. I don't always cook my zucchini, but if you prefer a warm version saut√© them in a pan.</li>
</ul>
<h2>sauce</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put <i>2 tbsp</i> of <a href='olive_oil.html'>olive oil</a> in a saucepan over medium heat, whisk in <i>2 tbsp</i> of <a href='all_purpose_flour.html'>all purpose flour</a>. Stir until it's completely absorbed by the oil. Let roux cook for a minute or so.</li>
<li>Stir in <i>2 cups</i> of <a href='vegetable_bouillon.html'>vegetable bouillon</a>, bring heat up to a boil and then lower to a simmer. Add a <i>1/4 cup</i> of <a href='shiitake_mushrooms.html'>shiitake mushrooms</a>, a <i>1/4 cup</i> of <a href='shimeji_mushrooms.html'>shimeji mushrooms</a> and a <i>1/3 cup</i> of <a href='edamame.html'>edamame</a> to the sauce.</li>
<li>Let cook for <u>10 minutes</u>.</li>
<li>When cooked, season sauce with salt and black pepper.</li>
