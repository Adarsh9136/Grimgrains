<h2>scrambled chickpeas</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a bowl, mix <i>1/2 cup</i> of <a href='chickpea_flour.html'>chickpea flour</a>, <i>1/4 cup</i> of <a href='nutritional_yeast.html'>nutritional yeast</a>, <i>1 tbsp</i> of <a href='tahini.html'>tahini</a> and a <i>pinch</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a>.</li>
<li>Bring a non-stick pan to medium heat. Sprinkle a bit water in the pan, if it sizzles pour the contents of the bowl into the pan. (this will make it stick less)</li>
<li>Let mixture heat for <u>3-5 minutes</u>.</li>
<li>When the edges start to cook, flip it and start to break it apart with the side of the spatula.</li>
<li>Let it cook <u>for a minute</u>, then continue to break it apart further. You'll need to do this repeatedly, until the mixture is broken up into smaller bits and until it has become dry and crisp for <u>8-10 minutes or so</u>. When cooking, it's important to stir often, and to constantly break it up into smaller bits so all sides can can cook.</li>
<li>NOTE: I like to use a spatula and a fork to break it up, and also to brush some of the batter off the spatula (it is very wet in the beginning and is a bit sticky). Serve into salads, or as a side for other dishes.</li>
