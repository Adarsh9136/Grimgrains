<li>Preheat oven to <u>400F</u>.</li>
<li>Bake potatoes until fork tender. Peel skins off and mash them up with a fork or food processor. Let cool completely (you can also boil them until fork tender).</li>

<li>Mix the potatoes in gradually, and knead until you get a consistent dough.</li>
<li>Sprinkle flour on your working surface, and divide your ball of dough into 4. Roll each section into a long rope with an approximate <i>2cm diameter</i>.</li>
<li>Proceed to cutting up the ropes into <i>2cm sections</i>.</li>
<li>To make the little lines over the gnocchis (optional, but fun), take each piece and make a ball with it. Press it up against the backside of a fork and slide it down all the way to the ends with your finger. Your ball will be left with sets of lines on top and will take its signature elongated shape.</li>
<li>Cook gnocchi in a pot of boiling water with salt, the bits that are ready will float back to the surface.</li>
