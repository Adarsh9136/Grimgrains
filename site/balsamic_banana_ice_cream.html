<h1>balsamic banana ice cream</h1>
<h2>balsamic reduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put <i>1 cup</i> of <a href='balsamic_vinegar.html'>balsamic vinegar</a> in a non-stick pan.</li>
<li>Bring up to medium high heat, once it starts to boil bring down to medium low and let simmer until the vinegar has been reduced by a little more than half. Stir it on occasion. Make sure you have an open window or the overhead fan running because boiling vinegar has a really strong smell!</li>
<li>Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, then store in the refrigerator. It will thicken when it gets cold. This recipe makes a lot of balsamic reduction, it's hard to make very little. It keeps in the refrigerator for a while so you can easily use it in other recipes. It's great when served over fruit.</li>
