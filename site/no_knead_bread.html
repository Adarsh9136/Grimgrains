<h1>no knead bread</h1>
<h2>bread preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a bowl, mix <i>2 cups</i> of all purpose flour, <i>1 cup</i> of <a href='spelt_flour.html'>spelt flour</a> (whole wheat works too), <i>1 tsp</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a>, and <i>1/2 tsp</i> of <a href='active_dry_yeast.html'>active dry yeast</a>. Mix well.</li>
<li>Add <i>1 1/2 cups</i> of <a href='water.html'>water</a> gradually, stirring it with a spoon into a cohesive dough. The dough will be wet - that's okay, there is no need to add extra flour.</li>
<li>Put a bag or cloth over the bowl, and let the dough rest <u>anywhere from 9 to 24 hours</u>. Ideally, prepare the dough in the evening and let it rest overnight.</li>
<li><u>Next morning:</u> Preheat your oven to <u>450F</u>, and add your dutch oven (or ovenproof pot with lid) in it. Pre-heating your container beforehand, will prevent the dough from sticking to the bottom. (To bake <b>without a dutch oven</b>, I have a mini-tutorial in the recipe description above.)</li>
<li>Place the wet dough on a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a rough ball. If too wet to handle, put some flour on your hands.</li>
<li>Once the oven is at temperature, carefully take out the dutch oven with oven mitts â€” careful, it's hot! Place your bread into the dutch oven. At this point, you can add some seeds overtop of the bread. In this recipe, I used <a href='sesame_seeds.html'>sesame seeds</a>, but <a href='poppy_seeds.html'>poppy seeds</a> or quick oats would also be good. Cover with lid and place back inside oven.</li>
<li>Bake for <u>30 minutes</u>.</li>
<li>After <u>30 minutes</u>, take the lid off, and let it cook uncovered for <u>another 7 minutes</u>.</li>
</ul>
