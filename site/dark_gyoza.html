<h1>dark gyoza</h1>
<h2>dough</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mix <i>2 cups</i> of <a href='all_purpose_flour.html'>all purpose flour</a> with <i>1 tsp</i> of <a href='bamboo_charcoal_powder.html'>bamboo charcoal powder</a> in a bowl.</li>
<li>Dissolve <i>1/2 tsp</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a> in <i>1/2 cup</i> of <a href='just-boiled_water.html'>just-boiled water</a>, and pour into the flour little by little while mixing.</li>
<li>Knead the dough on a clean flat surface for a few minutes until it becomes smooth. If your dough is too dry, add 1 tbsp of hot water and repeat as needed.</li>
<li><i>Separate the dough in 3</i>. Roll into balls and wrap them up with a bag or place in a lidded bowl, refrigerate for at least <u>30 minutes</u>. Leaving it to rest in the refrigerator makes the dough easier to manipulate afterwards.</li>
<li>Flatten each piece out with a rolling pin into a rough rectangle, thin enough so that you can run it through the pasta maker. Pass it through your pasta maker a few times, incrementing down to the thinnest setting gradually. You can use a rolling pin instead, it works but it takes a lot more effort. Both techniques work, this one just happens to be quicker and easier on your body. Note that depending on your pasta maker, the dough will come out a bit thicker than a traditional gyoza. If you want it thinner you can flatten it a bit more with a rolling pin.</li>
<li>Put the thin sheet of dough onto a clean flat surface. Take a can (with about a 3" diameter) and start to poke holes into it, these are your gyoza wrappers! You can use cookie cutters if you have some. I used an old chickpea can I had.</li>
<li>Pile the wrappers, sprinkle some <a href='cornstarch.html'>cornstarch</a> (or potato starch) inbetween each piece so they don't stick together. Put a damp towel over your wrappers so they don't dry out. Repeat this process for the other 2 portions of dough, and you can re-use the scraps and make new dough to run through the pasta maker.</li>
</ul>
<h2>filling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mix the <i>1/2 block</i> of <a href='tofu.html'>tofu</a>, the <i>2/3 cup</i> of <a href='coriander.html'>coriander</a>, the <i>4 grated</i> <a href='carrots.html'>carrots</a> and the <i>2 tsp</i> of <a href='ginger_root.html'>ginger root</a> together in a bowl. Add <i>2 tbsp</i> of <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a> as well as <a href='black_pepper.html'>black pepper</a> and <a href='salt.html'>salt</a> to taste. Mix.</li>
</ul>
<h2>dipping sauce</h2>
<ul>
<li>Combine <i>3 tbsp</i> of <a href='Japanese_rice_vinegar.html'>Japanese rice vinegar</a> with <i>3 tbsp</i> of <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a> and <i>1 tsp</i> of <a href='sesame_oil.html'>sesame oil</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>pan fry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take 1 gyoza wrapper (<a href='#dark_gyoza_wrappers.html'>see recipe</a>), wet all around the edge with water using your fingers. Keep a bowl of water close to dip your fingers in.</li>
<li>Put a spoonful of filling in the middle.</li>
<li>Close it. Make little folds with the flap that is facing you using both hands, leaving the back part smooth. Make sure it's sealed tight. Repeat for the rest of the gyoza skins, alternate between fillings. Cover with a damp towel while you work so they don't dry up.</li>
<li>Put some vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat. Add gyoza in 2 rows of 3 in the pan. Cook until bottom becomes golden.</li>
<li>Add <i>1/3 cup</i> of <a href='water.html'>water</a> and put a lid on. Let steam until all the water evaporates.</li>
<li>Add a bit of <a href='sesame_oil.html'>sesame oil</a> and cook until crispy.</li>
</ul>
